# /research-ideation [topic] -- Research Questions & Strategies

Generate structured research questions, testable hypotheses, and empirical strategies from a topic, phenomenon, or dataset description.

## Workflow
1. Parse input and review supporting documents/domain rules
2. Generate 3-5 research questions (descriptive -> correlational -> causal -> mechanism -> policy)
3. For each question specify: hypothesis, identification strategy, data needs, assumptions, pitfalls, literature
4. Rank questions by feasibility and contribution
5. Output markdown to `quality_reports/`

## Identification Rigor
Each causal question requires:
- Method (DiD, IV, RD, etc.)
- Treatment definition
- Control group selection
- Critical assumptions
- Anticipated threats to validity

## Data-Driven Approach
Require specific dataset identification and availability assessment rather than theoretical speculation.

## Output: Ranking table comparing research questions on feasibility and potential contribution.

# Exploration Folder Protocol

All exploratory projects reside in `explorations/` -- never in production folders.

## Structure
```
explorations/
  [project-name]/
    R/
    scripts/
    output/
    README.md
    SESSION_LOG.md
```

## Three Paths

1. **Graduate to production** -- score >= 80, tests pass, replicable, documented
2. **Continue development** -- update README with next steps
3. **Archive** -- move to ARCHIVE/ with explanation

## Graduation Checklist
- [ ] Quality score >= 80
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Results reproducible within tolerance
- [ ] Code intelligible without external context
- [ ] Methodology and discoveries documented

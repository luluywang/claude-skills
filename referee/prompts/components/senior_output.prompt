## File Naming

**Output file:** `{short_title}_{YYYYMMDD}_claude_senior_report.tex`

**Generate short_title from paper title:**
1. Take first 2-3 key words (skip articles: The, A, An)
2. Convert to lowercase
3. Replace spaces with underscores
4. Keep only alphanumeric and underscores
5. Limit to ~30 characters

**Add timestamp:** Use today's date in YYYYMMDD format (e.g., 20251231).

**Examples:**
- "The Effect of Minimum Wage on Employment" (reviewed 2025-12-31) → `minimum_wage_employment_20251231_claude_senior_report.tex`
- "Does Immigration Affect Wages?" (reviewed 2025-01-15) → `immigration_wages_20250115_claude_senior_report.tex`

\section{Summary of the Paper}

[1-2 paragraphs: Research question, data/method used, key findings. Neutral summary without evaluation.]

\section{Contribution Assessment}

[State the contribution in one sentence. Then evaluate: importance, magnitude of advance, novelty, broad relevance. Is this a significant advance or too incremental/narrow/unclear?]

\section{Literature Positioning}

[How well does the paper position itself in the literature? Accuracy of cited work, missing important papers, overclaims about novelty relative to existing work.]

\section{Deal Breakers}

\textit{Issues that prevent publication in current form:}

% If Deal Breakers exist:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{[Issue Title]}

    [Description of the issue with specific evidence from the paper - cite page numbers, tables, or quotes where relevant.]

    \textbf{Why this affects publishability:} [1-2 sentences explaining why this issue prevents publication at a top journal.]

    \item \textbf{[Next Issue Title]}

    [Continue for each Deal Breaker...]

\end{enumerate}

% If NO Deal Breakers:
% None identified from contribution perspective.

\section{Other Issues}

\textit{Issues that would improve the paper but are not blocking:}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item [Issue description]
    \item [Issue description]
\end{itemize}

## Section Guidelines

### Summary of the Paper
- Objective summary only
- No evaluation or critique here
- Focus on: question, data, method, headline findings

### Contribution Assessment
- Start with one-sentence contribution statement
- Be specific: "The paper's contribution is [X]"
- Evaluate against senior referee criteria from `senior.prompt`
- Include comparison to existing literature

### Literature Positioning
- Reference results from literature search (`notes/literature_context.md`)
- Cite specific papers that relate to claims
- Note missing citations or mischaracterizations

### Deal Breakers
- Each must have clear title, description, and impact explanation
- Cite specific evidence from paper (page numbers, tables)
- Impact explanation should be 1-2 sentences, not longer
- If none: Write "None identified from contribution perspective."

### Other Issues
- Bullet points, concise
- Can group related minor items
- No impact explanation needed

## Formatting Rules

- Use `\section{Title}` for sections (auto-numbered)
- Do NOT use `\section*{}` (unnumbered)
- Do NOT manually number sections
- Use `enumerate` for Deal Breakers, `itemize` for Other Issues
- Keep paragraphs focused; avoid walls of text

# Literature Search for Senior Referee

**Model Directive:** Use **Haiku** for this task. Simple web search queries do not require deep reasoning.

---

## Purpose

Execute literature searches BEFORE senior referee evaluation begins. Search results inform novelty and positioning assessment.

---

## Step 1: Extract Search Queries

Read the paper's introduction and identify:
1. **Topic Keywords**: Main subject matter (e.g., "EITC labor supply", "securitization screening")
2. **Contribution Claims**: What the paper claims is novel (typically intro paragraphs 3-5)
3. **Methodology**: Identification strategy (e.g., "regression discontinuity", "instrumental variables")

---

## Step 2: Execute Searches

Run three Gemini CLI commands (no date filter):

```bash
# Search 1: Topic Literature
gemini -p "Search economics literature for papers on [TOPIC]. List seminal papers, most cited works, recent contributions with authors, year, journal."

# Search 2: Contribution Verification
gemini -p "Search for economics papers that [PAPER'S CONTRIBUTION CLAIM]. List any overlapping papers with authors, year, findings."

# Search 3: Methodology Literature
gemini -p "Search for economics papers using [METHODOLOGY] to study [TOPIC]. List standard approaches and innovations."
```

## Step 3: Compile Literature Context

Output structured summary:

```markdown
### LITERATURE CONTEXT (from web search)

**Established Literature:**
- [3-5 key papers the paper SHOULD engage with]
- [Note if paper cites these or not]

**Contribution Verification:**
- [Prior papers making similar contributions, if any]
- [Assessment: Genuinely novel vs. potentially overclaimed]

**Methodology Context:**
- [Standard approaches in this area]
- [How paper's approach compares]

**Red Flags for Evaluation:**
- [Papers to check if cited]
- [Potential overclaims to scrutinize]
```

## Output

Save to `notes/literature_context.md` for use by senior evaluation.

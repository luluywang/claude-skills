Dear Toni,
Thank you very much for sending me the paper “Risk-Based Borrowing Limits in Credit Card
Markets,” MS 00233, to referee.
The paper empirically studies how lenders simultaneously set credit limits and interest rates in
the UK credit card market. The UK credit card market is interesting because there’s very little
variation in prices across consumers but there is substantial variation in credit limits. The key
novelty of the model is to model how lenders maximize profits by jointly maximizing prices and
credit limits. The author finds that credit limits play an important role in controlling the amount
lenders lose in default. The author also finds that allowing lenders in the UK to tailor prices
would dramatically increase the dispersion of prices, increase lender profits, and transfer
surplus from low-income consumers who are price-inelastic to high-income consumers who are
price-elastic.
I am somewhere between a rejection and a major revision. On one hand, the topic is important
and novel, and the author seems to have ideal data for studying it. However, there are various
points where the key results of the paper seem to follow from some strong model assumptions
rather than the data. While this is sometimes necessary, the paper is not transparent with how
these assumptions shape the results. The paper is also very long, which makes it difficult to
identify the central modeling choices. I’m very positive on the topic and would be excited to
read future iterations. However, as written, I believe that one round of revisions may not be
enough for publication given the high standards of the Journal of Financial Economics.
I hope these comments are useful.
Sincerely,
Lulu Wang

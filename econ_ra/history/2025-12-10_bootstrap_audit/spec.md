# Project Spec: Bootstrap Tables + J*=1 Clarification + Sector Fee Breakdown

## Tasks from User

1. **Bootstrap SE Verification**: Verify that the updated bootstrap procedure has been propagated through ALL standard error tables in the output.

2. **J*=1 Calibration Clarification**: For J*=1 calibration in sectors without large firms (not groceries/sector 7, not merchandise/sector 9), clarify the treatment - should J* be effectively zero or set to 100 (so it doesn't matter)?

3. **Welfare Effects in Four-Way Table**: If J*=1 calibration works, compute welfare effects from counterfactuals and add them to the four-way comparison table.

4. **Sector Fee Breakdown Table**: Create a table (internal, not for paper) showing how sector discrimination on different card types affects different consumer groups separately. Purpose: verify credit card intuition is correct and diagnose why regulated debit "goes the wrong way."

## Context

- This follows work on bootstrap standard errors and J*=1 robustness calibration
- The structural model has 6 sectors: 0, 5, 7, 9, 13, 15
- Sectors 7 (groceries) and 9 (merchandise) have large firms with bargaining power
- Other sectors (0, 5, 13, 15) do not have large firms

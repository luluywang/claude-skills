# History Directory

Past project logs are stored here. Each completed project gets its own folder:

```
history/
├── 2024-01-10_minwage/
│   ├── spec.md
│   ├── clarifications.md
│   ├── tasks.json
│   ├── checks.md
│   ├── session_log.md
│   └── retrospective.md
├── 2024-01-15_demand_est/
│   └── ...
```

The agent reads recent history to:
- Find similar past projects
- Learn from what worked and didn't
- Calibrate sense checks based on outcomes
- Avoid repeating questions you've already answered

# Writing Principles for Economics Research

*Condensed from McCloskey, Cochrane, and Chaubey*

## Core Philosophy

**Writing is thinking.** Content and style cannot be separated. You discover flaws in fundamentals through writing details. Write early rather than late.

**Clarity is paramount.** "Take care to write not merely so that the reader can understand but so that he cannot possibly misunderstand." —Quintilian

## I. Structure

### The Inverted Pyramid

Put the punchline first, then fill in details. Newspapers start with the most important part. Don't write like a mystery novel with reveal at the end.

- State your central contribution in the first paragraph
- Never make readers wait until Table 12 or the conclusion to learn main findings
- Readers skim rather than read linearly—accommodate them

### Get to Results Quickly

There should be nothing before the main result that a reader doesn't need to understand it.

Avoid:
- Long warm-up motivation
- Extensive literature review before explaining your contribution
- Preliminary estimates or replications before main results
- Data descriptions of well-known datasets

### Paragraph Structure

- First sentence should convey an idea, not detail
- First sentence should: (1) include main message, (2) link to overall story, (3) provoke follow-up questions
- 5-6 sentences per paragraph is ideal
- Don't bury key ideas at the bottom of paragraphs

## II. Style

### Be Concrete, Not Abstract

- "Machines and men" not "capital and labor"
- Singular words more concrete than plurals
- Provide concrete numbers: "coefficient is 0.03 (SE 0.01)" not "results show significance"

### Plain Language over Jargon

- "Use" not "utilize"
- "Several" not "diverse"
- "People" not "agents" or "individuals"
- Untie noun-stacking: "private wealth-seeking activity" → "seeking wealth"

### Active Voice

- "I assume τ = 3" not "it is assumed that τ = 3"
- "I construct the data as follows" not "data were constructed as follows"
- Search for "is" and "are" to root out passive constructions
- Use "we" to mean "you (reader) and I"

### Sentence Structure

- Use subject-verb-object order
- "People use a variety of insurance mechanisms" not "The insurance mechanisms that agents utilize... are diverse"
- Put important matter at the END of the sentence—that's the emphatic position
- Vary which part of the sentence is complex

### Conciseness

- Every word must count
- Don't repeat things—if said once, don't say again
- "In other words" signals you didn't say it right the first time
- Strike most adjectives and adverbs in revision
- Avoid elegant variation (calling same thing different names)

## III. Technical Elements

### Tables and Figures

- **Self-contained captions**: Skimming reader should understand without searching text
- **Regression tables**: Caption should include equation and variable names, especially dependent variable
- **No orphan numbers**: Every number in table must be discussed in text
- **Meaningful labels**: "Rich Budget Line" not "Locus QuERtY"
- **Sensible significant digits**: 4.6 ± 0.7, not 4.56783 ± 0.6789
- **Sensible units**: Report 2.3 rather than 0.0000023

### Equations

- Use words in displayed equations when possible: "Quantity of Grain = 3.56 + 5.6(Price)" better than "Q = 3.56 + 5.6P where Q is..."
- Define symbols clearly
- Remind readers of symbol meanings when reused

## IV. Empirical Work

### Identification (The Three Most Important Things)

1. Describe economic mechanism causing dispersion in right-hand variables
2. Describe economic mechanism constituting the error term
3. Explain why error term is uncorrelated with right-hand variables—in economic terms
4. Explain economics of why instruments are valid
5. Describe source of variation in data that drives every single number

### Stylized Facts

- Show the patterns in data that drive your result, not just estimates and p-values
- Explain economic significance, not just statistical significance
- In large panels, even tiny effects are "statistically significant"—focus on magnitude

## V. Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Instead |
|---------|---------|
| "This paper..." | Start with your contribution directly |
| Table-of-contents paragraphs | Let readers figure out structure |
| Passive voice | Use active voice and take responsibility |
| Naked "this" | "This regression shows..." not "This shows..." |
| "It should be noted that" | Just say it |
| Adjectives about own work | No "striking results," "very significant" |
| Traffic signals | Don't start sentences with Indeed, However, Furthermore |
| Elegant variation | Use ONE word to mean ONE thing consistently |
| "As we will see in Table 6" | Just present results when you get there |

## VI. Rules to Live By

### Orwell's Six Rules

1. Never use a metaphor you're used to seeing in print
2. Never use a long word where a short one will do
3. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out
4. Never use the passive where you can use the active
5. Never use jargon if you can think of an everyday equivalent
6. Break any rule sooner than say anything barbarous

### Twain's Seven Rules

1. Say what you're proposing to say, not merely come near it
2. Use the right word, not its second cousin
3. Eschew surplusage
4. Do not omit necessary details
5. Avoid slovenliness of form
6. Use good grammar
7. Employ a simple and straightforward style

## VII. AI Tells to Avoid

When writing, check for and eliminate:

- Em-dashes (—) used for asides—prefer commas or parentheses
- Semicolons joining independent clauses; prefer periods
- "Notably," "Importantly," "Crucially" starting sentences
- "This suggests," "This indicates" without clear antecedent
- "It is worth noting" — just note it
- Parallel structure that feels mechanical
- Overly smooth transitions (however, furthermore, moreover)
- Starting consecutive sentences with similar structure

*The ultimate goal: Write so that the reader cannot possibly misunderstand.*

A consumer’s utility declines in the mortgage rate 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 𝑟𝑟𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , with 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 measuring the consumer-specific
sensitivity to interest rates.
Borrower 𝑖𝑖’s mortgage amount 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖∗ can be smaller than her ideal mortgage size, 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 . If that is the case,
she suffers a disutility 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 𝐼𝐼(𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖∗ < 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 ), 10 where the borrower-specific coefficient 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 measures the extent
of disutility and I is the indicator function. This can occur when the borrower’s ideal mortgage is a
jumbo 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 > 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , but the borrower chooses a mortgage under the conforming limit 𝐼𝐼�𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖∗ < 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 �𝐼𝐼�𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 >
𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 �, or when a binding LTV constraint prevents the borrower from obtaining their ideal jumbo
mortgage 𝐼𝐼�𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖∗ > 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 �𝐼𝐼(𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 > �����
                                        𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 × 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 ).
Consumers also value mortgages on dimensions other than size and price. For example, conforming
mortgage approval and administrative procedures differ from those of jumbo mortgages. We allow
consumers to have different preferences over these non-rate attributes of conforming relative to jumbo
mortgages, captured by 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 . Consumers also value lenders’ convenience and/or service quality.
Intuitively, consumers like to borrow from fintech shadow banks such as Quicken Loans because they
offer a convenient way to interact online. 𝑞𝑞𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝜉𝜉𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 measures convenience differences between
lenders. 𝑞𝑞𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is the year-lender type invariant quality difference, 11 and 𝜉𝜉𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is a year-lender market-
specific unobservable. 𝑞𝑞𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is estimated as a year-lender type fixed effect, and is thus observable by
the researcher, while 𝜉𝜉𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is not. Last, borrowers’ preferences over lenders differ idiosyncratically,
which is captured in the i.i.d. T1EV borrower-specific utility shock 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 . For example, some
borrowers prefer to borrow from JPMorgan Chase over Quicken because they have a bank account
with the former, making it easier to transact.
The ideal mortgage size, interest rate sensitivity, relative preference for a conforming loan, as well as
the cost of departing from the ideal mortgage size are consumer specific. Consumers’ preferences are
drawn from a distribution, where the distribution is a function of income and house prices in a market.
Specifically, let Β𝑖𝑖 ≡ (𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 , 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 , 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 , 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 )′ describe consumer preferences, then:
                                                                       � + Π(𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 − 𝐷𝐷
                                                                 Β𝑖𝑖 = Β                � ) + Σ𝜈𝜈𝑖𝑖               (D.3)

  A consumer will never choose a mortgage which is too large.

  Because of large changes in the quality of fintech providers over time, we allow the quality of fintech shadow banks to
evolve over time as well.

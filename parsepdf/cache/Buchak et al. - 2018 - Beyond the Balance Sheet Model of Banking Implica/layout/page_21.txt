to retain as portfolio loans on the balance sheet 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , and how many to finance (the remainder)

through GSE securitization 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 − 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 . Jumbo mortgages cannot be securitized and are retained

on the balance sheet 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 . Each bank has only one balance sheet across markets in which
                              𝑏𝑏             𝑏𝑏
it participates. Denote by 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = ∑𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 the amount of type g mortgages that lender j chooses to
retain on the balance sheet. In other words, suppose the bank originates conforming loans in the New
York City and Houston MSAs, and it chooses to finance $100 million on its balance sheet. From a
financing perspective, it does not matter which market these loans were originated in.
IV.B.1 Origination
Mortgage origination is costly, beyond the mere financing cost of a mortgage. Lenders incur non-
financing costs such as costs of an appraisal and title check, document processing, and loan closure,
which involve labor and equipment. We designate the per-dollar origination cost of lender j of
mortgage type g as 𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , and the total origination cost in market ct is:

                                                � 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗                                   (S.1)
                                                 𝑔𝑔

This specification allows for different origination costs across banks, non-fintech shadow banks, and
fintech shadow banks. For example, this heterogeneity allows us to capture potential cost savings
from technology employed by fintech shadow banks who use less labor in lending.
IV.B.2 Financing and Regulatory Burden
Recall that mortgages can be financed two ways. Conforming mortgages can be sold to GSEs, i.e.,
OTD. Alternatively, conforming and jumbo mortgages can be financed by using a bank’s internal
funds as portfolio loans. These two types of financing can have different costs.
Originate-to-Distribute Financing
Lenders can securitize conforming mortgages though GSEs. Since GSEs purchase mortgages at
predetermined prices, all lenders face the same originate-to-distribute financing cost in a given
market, which we model as an ability to obtain funding for a conforming mortgage at a rate
𝜎𝜎𝑡𝑡𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 = 𝜎𝜎𝑡𝑡𝑏𝑏 + 𝜎𝜎 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 . Here 𝜎𝜎𝑡𝑡𝑏𝑏 represents the underlying financing costs of funding absent any costs
arising from intermediation and captures the current interest rate environment in the macroeconomy.
𝜎𝜎 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 captures additional costs coming from the lender using GSE financing, which can include the
guarantee fee (g-fee) charged by the GSEs for coverage of projected credit losses from borrower
defaults in the securitized pools. In other words, when the firm originates-to-distribute a mortgage, it
earns the spread on the mortgage rate minus the financing and non-financing origination costs 𝑟𝑟𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 −
𝜎𝜎𝑡𝑡𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 − 𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 for every dollar of the mortgage. Reflecting the post-crisis period, which we study, we
assume that securitization is only available for conforming loans; jumbo loans must be retained on
balance sheet. One could easily account for a jumbo securitization in the same way (see Section V.E).

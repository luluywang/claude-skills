relative variation in conforming and jumbo interest rates that is driven by GSE institutional constraints
and not by borrower demand.
In addition to aggregate data, we also exploit several novel micro-level data moments. First, we use
the mean and standard deviation of realized loan sizes for jumbo and conforming loans within a
market. Second, we use two moments around the conforming limit discontinuity: the market share of
borrowers who obtain conforming loans exactly at the conforming loan limit (see Figure 7A) and the
income difference between borrowers exactly at the conforming loan limit and those nearby (see
Figure 7B).
Identification Discussion:
While all moments jointly identify the parameters of the model, here we provide an informal
discussion of how different moments in the data relate to the identification of different parameters.
As in Berry et al. (1995) and Nevo (2000), the aggregate market shares allow us to identify the
distribution of preferences for interest rates and non-price attributes of mortgages, once we instrument
for price. The price variation induced by the GSE cost shocks allows us to identify the price sensitivity
for consumers, 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 . Variation in market shares for a given interest rate across lenders allows us to
estimate consumer preferences over non-price attributes, 𝑞𝑞𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝜉𝜉𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 . Intuitively, if Quicken has a
larger market share for mortgages for a given interest rate, it must be because consumers value
Quicken’s convenient mortgage screening and documentation system.
Jointly with the aggregate moments, the micro-moments allow us to estimate the preferences for other
parameters of the model. Intuitively, consumers who choose a jumbo mortgage choose the mortgage
at their ideal size (subject to the consumer-specific LTV constraint). Similarly, consumers who
choose a conforming mortgage below the conforming limit choose a mortgage at their ideal size
(subject to LTV constraint). Intuitively, the mean and standard deviation of realized loan sizes for
jumbo and conforming loans within a market are very informative about the distribution of ideal loan
sizes 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 , once we account for the behavior at the discontinuity.
The parameter 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 governs behavior at the discontinuity, and consequently the distribution of loan
sizes around the discontinuity are highly informative in identifying these parameters. Recall that a
consumer choosing a smaller-than-ideal mortgage suffers disutility 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 . Consider a consumer whose
ideal mortgage size is greater than the conforming limit. She has three choices: obtain a jumbo
mortgage at the ideal size, obtain a conforming mortgage that is too small—perhaps at a lower rate,
or exit the market entirely. When 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 is large, she will be unlikely to take a smaller conforming loan
unless the interest rate differential and her price sensitivity are large. In contrast, when 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 is small she
is more likely to take a conforming mortgage exactly at the conforming loan cutoff. Therefore, all
else equal, 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 governs the amount of bunching at the conforming loan cutoff. Large 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 leads to less
bunching and small 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 leads to more bunching. Consequently, the average level of 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 is identified
from the observed bunching in the data, and 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 ’s covariance with income and house price is identified
by how bunching varies with income and house prices in the data.
Besides taking a smaller conforming loan, the consumer has the option to obtain a jumbo loan or exit
the market entirely. If 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 is high, holding the conforming market share fixed, then jumbo loans are

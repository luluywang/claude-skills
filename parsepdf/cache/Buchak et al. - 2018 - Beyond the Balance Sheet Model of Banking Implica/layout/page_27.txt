The origination amount weighted mean of 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 is 10.2% and the median is 0. The
specifications to test the impact of these limit increases on jumbo and bank share are as follows:
                     %𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝑜𝑜𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 = 𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝛾𝛾𝑐𝑐 + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 + 𝜖𝜖𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐                         (3)

Where 𝛾𝛾𝑐𝑐 and 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 are county and year fixed effects, respectively.
Specification (3) investigates whether jumbo share of originations declines along with conforming
loan limit increases. Column 1 of Table 6 shows that increasing the conforming loan limit by 1%
leads to an approximately 0.35% reduction in the jumbo share in the county. These estimates from
actual data compare well with model counterfactual estimates where we simulate a similar change in
conforming limits and assess the response. Table 11 finds a similar reduction of 0.31%. As the
conforming loan limit increases, there is a significant shift towards conforming loans.
Specification (4) tests the extent of declines in bunching, which is measured as the number of
conforming originations within 0.1% of the conforming loan limit. Column 2 of Table 6 shows that
when the conforming loan limit increases the mass of borrowers exactly at the conforming loan cutoff
decreases, suggesting that many of these borrowers would have selected larger loans had the
conforming loan limits not been in place, and now that the limit has been relaxed, they are able to
select larger, now conforming loans. As Figure 8B shows, the model closely captures the market
shares of borrowers within a 5% band both above and below the conforming loan limit.
Specification (5) tests whether bank market share declines. Column 3 of Table 6 shows that a 1%
increase in the conforming loan limit decreases bank market share by roughly 0.03% percentage
points. Again, this estimate from actual data is consistent with that produced by our model (see
counterfactual in Table 11), which finds that a 1% increase in the jumbo loan limit leads to roughly a
0.08% decrease in bank market share around the limit. 13
Price Sensitivity
Our estimates of mean price sensitivity in Table 5 suggest that borrowers are quite price elastic, and
the differences in price elasticity are small. The mean parameter 𝛼𝛼� = 1.14 from Table 5A implies a
price elasticity of roughly 4.4. This estimate is close to DeFusco and Paciorek (2017), who estimate
the elasticity from the conforming loan discontinuity using a different approach. The estimate of 𝜎𝜎𝛼𝛼2 =
0.07 in Table 5C suggests moderate borrower differences in price elasticity, ranging from 4 to 5.12
for borrowers two standard deviations above and below the mean in price sensitivity. Second, for a

   We also measure the change in bank market share as more jumbo loans are originated by using the following
specification: 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 = 𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝛾𝛾𝑐𝑐 + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 + 𝜖𝜖𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 . The results in Table 6, Column 4 find a positive and
significant association between bank share and jumbo share. This coefficient, here estimated as roughly 0.25, is roughly
in line with the relationship suggested in the model from Tables 9, 10, and 11, which finds that bank share increases by
roughly 0.50 percentage points per percent increase in jumbo market share. Note that variation in jumbo share from the
regression above obtains from all sources, such as variation in demand, supply, and policy, whereas the cross-validating
variation in the model comes entirely from policy variation where one would expect a stronger relationship between
jumbo share and bank share.

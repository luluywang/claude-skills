Costs of Portfolio Lending
The cost of portfolio lending depends on the composition of the lender’s balance sheet and the amount
of equity capital 𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 . A lender sources financing at the firm level and has one balance sheet comprising
mortgage assets across markets. There are two types of assets held on a lender’s balance sheet:
mortgages—the amount of which is chosen by the lender in each market—and other assets in the
𝑏𝑏
amount 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗
. The choice of the latter is determined outside the model and represent other assets that
the bank chooses to hold on the balance sheet such as government bonds or commercial loans which
it did not securitize. Lenders also differ in the amount of equity capital 𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 . The amount of equity and
the asset composition of the balance sheet jointly determine the cost of portfolio lending for an
intermediary. While these quantities are fixed in the baseline model, in Section V.E we allow for
costly equity issuance as well as liquidating of non-mortgage assets.
A lender’s risk-adjusted capital ratio 𝜌𝜌𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 depends on the banks equity capital 𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 and banks’ risk-

(S.2)

Where 𝜉𝜉𝑔𝑔 represents the risk weight of mortgages of type g and 𝜉𝜉𝑜𝑜 represents the risk weight of other
assets the bank holds. Since jumbo mortgages have higher risk weights, they use up more statutory
capital per dollar of actual lending. A bank’s capital needs to be below its statutory capital requirement
𝜌𝜌̅ if it wants to lend on its balance sheet.
The per-dollar cost of financing a portfolio loan of lender j depends on its capitalization:
𝑝𝑝

𝜎𝜎𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = 𝜎𝜎𝑡𝑡𝑏𝑏 + 𝜎𝜎 𝑏𝑏1 �𝜌𝜌𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 − 𝜌𝜌̅ �

−𝜙𝜙

(S.3)

As before, 𝜎𝜎𝑡𝑡𝑏𝑏 represents the underlying financing costs of funding in the macroeconomy.

𝜎𝜎 𝑏𝑏1 �𝜌𝜌𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 − 𝜌𝜌̅ �

−𝜙𝜙

is the shadow cost of balance-sheet funding above this base rate. The closer a bank’s

risk-adjusted capital ratio is to the statutory requirement, i.e., the smaller �𝜌𝜌𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 − 𝜌𝜌̅ �, the larger the

cost of portfolio loan financing. 𝜙𝜙 and 𝜎𝜎 𝑏𝑏1 parameterize the extent of this cost. This formulation
captures the fact that banks choose a capital buffer above the hard capital requirement. The microfoundations of such a buffer can be generated in a dynamic setting but are not the central interest in
this paper (see Corbae and D'Erasmo (2019)). We assume that balance sheet lending by shadow banks
is prohibitively expensive. This assumption captures in reduced form the notion that shadow banks
do not have access to a subsidized deposit funding and must use external financing instead.

Regulatory Burden
Banks face regulatory pressures beyond capital requirements. These regulatory pressures constrain
banks’ lending activity even if banks are well capitalized. Rather than changing costs of lending,
which we model directly, regulatory burdens may also reduce traditional banks’ activity on the
extensive margin. For example, risk constraints and fear of enforcement or lawsuits may sometimes

cutoff and estimate the extent of the discontinuity at the conforming loan limit using the following
regression discontinuity specification:
𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽 × 𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖′ Γ + 𝛾𝛾𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 + 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,

(1)

where 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a {0,1} indicator variable for whether the loan i in census tract l originated in year
t is financed on the balance sheet or originated at a bank, respectively. 𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖 is an indicator for
whether the loan size is above the conforming loan limit in the time-county of origination, and the
corresponding coefficient 𝛽𝛽 is the object of interest. 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖′ is a vector of loan-level controls including log
loan size, log applicant income, and dummy variables for race, ethnicity, sex, loan type, loan purpose,
occupancy, and property type. 𝛾𝛾𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 is a census tract-origination year fixed effect, which absorbs any
variation in local conditions over time, as well as regulatory differences. In other words, we examine
the effect by comparing loans from the same census tract and year around the conforming limit,
adjusting for observable borrower differences. For robustness, we also experiment with larger
samples, those within 5%, 10%, and 25% of the conforming loan limit.
Table 2A shows that loans directly above the conforming loan limit experience about 50 pp increase
in the share of loans financed on the balance sheet. Increasing the bandwidth above 1% produces
similar results, as shown in columns 2–4. In 2015, the most recent year in our sample with complete
data coverage, this association is even stronger: the share of loans financed on the balance sheet jumps
by about 47 pp to 62 pp above the conforming loan limit (columns 5–8).
Table 2B shows that loans directly above the conforming loan limit are nearly 25 pp more likely to
have been originated by a traditional bank, as opposed to a shadow bank. As above, when considering
only loans originated in 2015, this difference grows to 38 pp. Increasing the bandwidth above 1%
produces similar results, as shown in columns 2–4. The results around the discontinuity illustrate that
traditional banks specialize in originating mortgages, which have to be retained on the balance sheet,
and not simply mortgages, which are large.
III.B.2 Within-Bank Analysis: Balance Sheet Capacity and the Balance Sheet Retention Margin
In the previous section, we look at market segmentation between banks and shadow banks. In this
section, we look within banks. We do so for two reasons. First, we use within-bank analysis to show
that balance sheet capacity is driving banks’ comparative advantage in the jumbo market, rather than
other regulatory differences with shadow banks. Second, we provide microevidence for the balance
sheet retention margin within banks.
Market Segmentation and Balance Sheet Capacity: Conforming Loan Limit Discontinuity
Our findings above are consistent with the idea that banks’ ability to finance loans with their balance
sheets generates a strong comparative advantage in the segment for difficult-to-sell loans—i.e., jumbo
loans. However, balance sheet capacity is not the only differentiating factor between banks and
shadow banks; for example, shadow banks are subject to a very different regulatory burden than
traditional banks (see Buchak et al. (2018)). If low balance-sheet capacity is the source of market
segmentation between banks and shadow banks, then we should observe similar segmentation
between well-capitalized and poorly capitalized banks.

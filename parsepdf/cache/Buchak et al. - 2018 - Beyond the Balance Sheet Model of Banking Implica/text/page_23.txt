prevent a traditional bank from lending to a given borrower altogether (Buchak et al. 2018). We
capture this type of regulatory burden through parameter 1/𝜁𝜁𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 .

For banks, the probability of lending to a specific borrower of mortgage g in market ct is scaled by a
factor 𝜁𝜁𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 . A higher 1/𝜁𝜁𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 (lower 𝜁𝜁𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 ) captures a relatively constrained bank; a lower 1/𝜁𝜁𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 (higher
𝜁𝜁𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 ) captures a relatively unconstrained bank. These shocks are i.i.d. across lender-borrower pairs,
which accounts for the uncertainty that a bank faces with respect to which loans may be subject to
these issues ex post.

IV.B.3 Choosing Mortgage Rates and Financing
Taking other lenders’ actions as given, an individual lender maximizes its profits by setting interest
rates across all markets and chooses how many mortgages to retain on its balance sheet. Denote by
𝒓𝒓𝒋𝒋𝒋𝒋 the set of prices of all products, conforming and jumbo, across all markets for lender j at time t,
𝒓𝒓𝒋𝒋𝒋𝒋 = {𝑟𝑟𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 : ∀𝑐𝑐, 𝑔𝑔}. Lender j chooses each rate. Since all jumbo mortgages are securitized, the only
decision in addition to setting interest rates is how many, if any, conforming mortgages to retain on

maximizing profits:

The first term, labeled rate income, is the yearly income that the lender earns from the loans that it
has made, equal to the sum of interest rates times mortgage volumes across all loan types and markets.
The second term, labeled origination cost, is the costs the lender occurs in originating the loans, such
as the wages of mortgage brokers, advertising, and administrative expense. The third term, labeled
financing cost, is the financing cost of the mortgage, reflecting the costs of either GSE or balancesheet financing, depending on the lender’s optimal financing cost.
Intermediaries’ profits comprise interest rate income (either collected by themselves or through
servicing rights), origination costs, and financing costs. Note that interest rates enter profits both
directly and indirectly through market shares. Market shares are also affected by regulatory
constraints. In other words, the amount of mortgages originated, 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , is implicitly a function of both
the interest rates of the lender 𝒓𝒓𝒋𝒋𝒋𝒋 , other lenders 𝒓𝒓−𝒋𝒋𝒋𝒋 , and the regulatory burden parameter 𝜁𝜁𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 , which
we omit for ease of notation.
IV.B.4 Equilibrium
We study symmetric equilibria. Demand is characterized by consumers’ choice of mortgages and
market share equations. Consumers maximize utility-taking prices and lender characteristics as given.
Supply is characterized by intermediaries’ maximization in S.4. Banks, non-fintech shadow banks,
and fintech shadow banks set mortgage rates across all markets in which they participate. Moreover,

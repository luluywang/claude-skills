highly inconvenient and the consumer is more likely to exit the market entirely rather than obtain a
jumbo loan. In contrast, when 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 is low, jumbo loans are relatively convenient and the consumer is
more likely to remain in the market. That is, 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 governs the missing mass of borrowers whose ideal
loan size is jumbo, but because jumbo loans are inconvenient and conforming loans are too small,
decide to exit the market entirely. Observe from Figure 7A that there is indeed a missing mass of
jumbo borrowers: the density of mortgages drops discontinuously above the conforming loan limit in
excess of the bunching at the limit. That is, consumers value the convenience of conforming
mortgages. Put another way, holding market size constant on the extensive margin, 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 governs the
relative market shares of conforming and jumbo mortgages, with a high 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 leading to relatively more
conforming loans. Consequently, the average level of 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 is identified from the relative market shares
of conforming and jumbo loans holding overall market shares fixed, while 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 ’s covariance with
income and house price is identified based on how these relative market shares vary with wage and
house prices in the data.
The last micro-moment we match is the income difference between borrowers exactly at the
conforming loan limit and those nearby (see Figure 7B). Intuitively, the larger the income spike at the
discontinuity, the less sensitive the higher-income population is to taking a mortgage which is smaller
than ideal. This moment aids in identifying the correlation between income and preferences for a
jumbo mortgage, i.e., the structure of the correlation in the random coefficients.
Model Fit: Targeted Moments and Simulated Responses to Real Policy Changes
We estimate the model over the period 2010–2015. The demand parameter estimates are shown in
Table 5. By construction, the model fits market shares data. The model also fits the size distribution
of mortgages in the data quite well. Figure 8B shows the model replicates the average amount of
bunching at the conforming loan limit generated by our model. Figure 8A shows that the model can
replicate the qualitatively bunching patterns across markets and does well in quantitatively matching
the extent of bunching. We overestimate the extent of bunching in the markets with the most
bunching. Intuitively, these are markets with the highest demand for jumbo mortgages. The difference
between data and model estimates is likely due to approximating the desired loan size with a lognormal distribution. Markets in which desired loan sizes are large will also be high variance, so the
log-normal distribution will put a lot of mass to the right.
We also examine the fit of the model by confronting it with actual policy changes. We exploit changes
to conforming loan limits over time in the U.S. mortgage market between 2007 and 2016. We compute
market outcomes using model estimates, and compare model-predicted changes to those from the
data. The main variables of interest at the level of county and origination year are jumbo origination
share (%Jumbo), bank origination share (%Bank), and the mass of borrowers at conforming limit
cutoff (%AtCutoff). The main explanatory variable captures the change in conforming limit in a given
county in a given year. We measure increases as the percentage difference between the conforming
loan limit in year t in county c and the conforming loan limit in 2007 for the same county c:

balance sheet capacity is fixed and allow banks to alter balance sheet capacity through equity issuance
and asset sales.
Following the current institutional setup of the U.S. mortgage market, a central distinction between
jumbo and conforming mortgages is that only conforming mortgages can be financed by originating
to distribute; jumbo loans are portfolio loans. Moreover, only banks can access deposits, which give
them the ability to finance portfolio loans. 9 Shadow banks can only originate to distribute. With this
setup, our model generates endogenous market segmentation between traditional and shadow banks
and within the traditional banking sector between well-capitalized and poorly capitalized banks. In
Section V.E we extend our analysis to allow jumbo mortgage securitization.
On the demand side, we build a rich discrete-continuous choice framework with an application to the
mortgage market. Importantly, we allow preferences of borrowers to be correlated with their income
and house prices. These differences in preferences, especially for larger mortgages, play a critical role
in studying the distributional aspects of policies.
IV.A Demand
A market 𝑐𝑐 in year t is defined at the MSA-loan purpose level. For example, a market may be
borrowers in New York City attempting to refinance their mortgages. Each market has 𝑖𝑖 = 1, … , 𝐼𝐼𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐
consumers, with an ideal mortgage size 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 , and 𝑗𝑗 = 1, … , 𝐽𝐽 lenders.

Lenders can offer up to two types of products: conforming and jumbo mortgages. Conforming
mortgage amounts that are available to an individual borrower, 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , have to satisfy two constraints.
����
First, the amount must be below the market-specific conforming loan limit 𝐹𝐹
𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 , which is $417,000 in
most markets during our estimation period. Second, the loan has to satisfy the individual-specific
����� × 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 is the LTV constraint times the borrower’s house price. Then the
LTV constraint, where 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿
individual’s maximum conforming loan size 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the minimum of the market-level conforming
level, and the LTV constraint:
����
�����
𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = min{𝐹𝐹
𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 , 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 × 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 }

(D.1)

Any mortgage that does not satisfy these two conditions is a jumbo mortgage. Jumbo mortgages must
also satisfy the LTV constraint, i.e., the chosen mortgage size 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖∗ ≤ �����
𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 × 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 . Let 𝑔𝑔 ∈ {𝐶𝐶, 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁} denote
whether the mortgage is conforming (C) or jumbo (NC). Conditional on an offered rate, consumers
can choose any loan size subject to the limits described above.
Consumers’ utility from a mortgage depends on the mortgage interest rate 𝑟𝑟𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , the chosen mortgage
size 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖∗ , which can differ from the ideal mortgage size 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 , and the convenience or quality of the service
provided by the lender:

Because banks have access to a subsidized funding of their balance sheet through insured deposits, one can model the
shadow bank decision not to engage in balance sheet lending as a competitive outcome with a corner solution.

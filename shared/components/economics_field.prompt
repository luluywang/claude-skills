# Economics Field Conventions

## Natural Field Shorthand

Economists use natural shorthand that should NOT be flagged as errors or "expanded":

### Methodology shorthand:
- "IV diff-in-diff" (not "instrumented difference-in-differences design")
- "RD" or "RDD" (regression discontinuity)
- "OLS" (ordinary least squares)
- "2SLS" or "TSLS" (two-stage least squares)
- "FE" (fixed effects)
- "RE" (random effects)
- "GMM" (generalized method of moments)
- "ML" or "MLE" (maximum likelihood estimation)

### Data/specification terms:
- "Standard errors clustered at X level"
- "Controls for X"
- "Sample weights"
- "Balanced panel"
- "Event study"
- "Staggered rollout"

### Economic concepts (when appropriate):
- "Elasticity" (vs. "price elasticity of demand" every time)
- "Utility" (not "utility function" repeatedly)
- "Returns to scale"
- "Externality"

**Key principle:** Don't over-explain standard econometric terms to field experts.

## What NOT to Over-Explain

### Economics 101 concepts
DO NOT explain these to field experts:
- Sales tax is a consumption tax
- Supply and demand
- Marginal effects
- Elasticity concept
- Basic market structures (monopoly, competition)
- Consumer surplus, producer surplus
- Comparative statics
- Diminishing returns

### Standard econometric concepts
DO NOT explain these to field experts:
- What fixed effects control for
- What clustering does
- Basic IV logic
- What a standard error is
- Difference-in-differences intuition (brief mention OK, full explanation not needed)

**Exception:** If your paper type is B (specialized topic) and you're writing for broader audience, more explanation may be appropriate.

## Appropriate Passive Voice in Economics

Economics appropriately uses passive voice in certain contexts. DO NOT flag these:

### Appropriate passive:
- "The model is estimated using..."
- "Results are presented in Table X"
- "The data are drawn from..."
- "Standard errors are clustered at..."
- "The sample is restricted to..."
- "Observations are weighted by..."

**Why:** These emphasize the methods/data/results over the researcher's actions, which is conventional in empirical work.

### Inappropriate passive to flag:
- "It is assumed that..." → "I assume that..."
- "It was found that..." → "I find that..."
- "It should be noted that..." → Just state it
- "It is shown that..." → "I show that..." or "Table X shows that..."

**Key distinction:** Passive is fine for methodological descriptions; not fine for hiding who makes assumptions or interpretations.

---

## Field-Appropriate Hedging

### Appropriate hedging (don't remove):
- "The results suggest..." (when causality is genuinely uncertain)
- "This is consistent with..." (when showing consistency, not proving causation)
- "One interpretation is..." (when multiple interpretations exist)
- "Under the assumption that..." (explicitly stating assumptions)

### Inappropriate hedging (should strengthen):
- "Our results suggest that X causes Y" when you have credible identification → "We find that X causes Y"
- "The results indicate that" when results clearly show → "The results show that"
- "We find evidence suggesting that" when evidence is strong → "We find that"
- "This pattern appears to arise because" when mechanism is clear → Direct statement

**Key principle:** Hedge when genuine uncertainty exists, but don't weaken claims when evidence is strong.

---

## Citation Conventions

### Natural citation styles:
- "Chetty and Hendren (2018) show that..."
- "Following Autor et al. (2013), we..."
- "This finding echoes Card and Krueger (1994)..."
- "See, e.g., Gentzkow and Shapiro (2010) and DellaVigna and Gentzkow (2010)."

### Weak citation patterns to improve:
- "This is consistent with findings in the literature" → Name specific papers
- "Previous research has shown" → "X and Y find that..."
- "Studies have found" → Cite specific studies
- "It has been documented that" → "X documents that..."

**Key principle:** Give credit specifically, not vaguely.

---

## Appropriate Formality Level

Economics papers have a professional but not overly formal register:

### Appropriate:
- "We find that..."
- "This suggests..."
- "Our estimates show..."
- "The data reveal..."
- "Consider the case where..."

### Too informal:
- "It turns out that..."
- "Basically, the idea is..."
- "Obviously, this means..."
- "Let's look at..."

### Too formal (overly bureaucratic):
- "It is incumbent upon us to note..."
- "One is compelled to observe..."
- "The aforementioned results..."
- "Heretofore, the literature has..."

**Key principle:** Professional but direct. Write like a confident expert, not a committee.

---

## Results Presentation Conventions

### Standard formulations (don't flag):
- "Column (1) shows OLS estimates; column (2) adds controls"
- "Table X presents summary statistics"
- "Figure Y plots the relationship between..."
- "Panel A restricts to..."
- "The coefficient on X is 0.23 (SE = 0.05)"
- "The effect is significant at the 1% level"

### Improvements when appropriate:
- "Column (1) presents OLS estimates" → "Column (1) shows OLS estimates" (use simpler verb)
- But don't flag "presents" as error - it's standard

### Formulations to strengthen:
- "The results suggest a positive effect" → "The results show a positive effect" (when identification is credible)
- "We find evidence of" → "We find" (when evidence is strong)

## Economics-Specific Acronyms

### Standard acronyms (don't spell out every time):
- EITC (Earned Income Tax Credit) - spell out first use
- GDP (Gross Domestic Product) - spell out first use
- CPI (Consumer Price Index) - spell out first use
- ACS (American Community Survey) - spell out first use
- PSID (Panel Study of Income Dynamics) - spell out first use

**Convention:** Spell out on first use with acronym in parentheses, then use acronym.

### Don't create acronyms for:
- Terms used only 2-3 times (just spell out)
- Short phrases (3-4 words)
- Terms readers need to understand fully each time

**Key principle:** Acronyms should aid reading, not create cognitive load.

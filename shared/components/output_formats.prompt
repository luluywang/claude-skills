## introduction.tex

### - [ ] Lines 45-52: Em-dash overuse creating monotonous rhythm

**Comment:**
Three consecutive sentences use em-dashes as crutch for weak sentence structure. Pattern "X---which is Y---suggests Z" repeated. This creates robotic uniformity and flags as AI-generated. The em-dashes are masking that these should be separate, varied sentences.

**Original:**
```
The policy change---which occurred in 2008---had significant effects on behavior.
The mechanism---operating through incentive channels---is straightforward.
Our findings---robust to multiple specifications---suggest substantial impacts.
```

**Proposed Revision:**
```
The policy changed in 2008 and had significant effects on behavior. The mechanism
is straightforward: it operates through incentive channels. Our findings suggest
substantial impacts. These results are robust to multiple specifications.
```

**Why better:** Removes em-dash crutch, varies sentence length (short + medium + short), uses colon appropriately for one emphasis point, sounds more natural.

---

### - [ ] Lines 78-85: Formulaic list structure (First... Second... Third...)

**Comment:**
Artificial enumeration structure typical of AI. The "Our first fact... Our second fact... Our third fact" pattern is mechanical and unnatural for economics writing.

**Original:**
```
Our first fact is that participation rates vary substantially across regions.
Our second fact is that this variation correlates with policy knowledge. Our
third fact is that the correlation persists after controlling for observables.
```

**Proposed Revision:**
```
Participation rates vary substantially across regions. This variation correlates
with policy knowledge, even after controlling for observables.
```

**Why better:** Combines related points naturally, eliminates formulaic enumeration, flows like expert would write it.

### - [ ] Lines 34-41: Hedging weak claims when identification is strong

**Comment:**
"Our results suggest that" appears 3 times when identification strategy is credible enough for stronger claims. This hedging is AI-typical and weakens the contribution. With a strong natural experiment, findings should be stated directly, not tentatively.

**Original:**
```
Our results suggest that the EITC increases labor force participation. The evidence
indicates that effects are concentrated on the extensive margin. Our findings appear
to show that intensive margin responses are minimal.
```

**Proposed Revision:**
```
The EITC increases labor force participation. Effects concentrate on the extensive
margin; intensive margin responses are minimal.
```

**Why better:** Direct claims match identification strength, more confident tone, eliminates AI hedging pattern, reads like expert wrote it.

---

### - [ ] Lines 89-97: Meta-commentary scaffolding

**Comment:**
"We begin by documenting... We then... Finally..." is AI-typical roadmap language. This scaffolding is unnecessary—just present the analysis. Readers will follow the logic without explicit signposting.

**Original:**
```
We begin by documenting the extent of geographic variation in EITC knowledge.
We then examine how this variation correlates with labor market outcomes. Finally,
we present our main identification strategy exploiting policy changes at childbirth.
```

**Proposed Revision:**
```
EITC knowledge varies substantially across ZIP codes—from 6.5% manipulation in
Chicago to 0.6% in Rapid City. We exploit this variation, combined with policy
changes at childbirth, to identify labor supply effects.
```

**Why better:** Eliminates scaffolding, shows concrete example immediately, gets to identification faster, no AI meta-commentary.

# Word Choice Review
**Date:** [date]
**Reviewer:** [name]

Focus: Clear, concrete, punchy word choices based on Cochrane and McCloskey's guidance.

**Target:** Line-by-line review flagging weak/vague/pretentious words

---

## Summary

- **Total suggestions:** [N]
- **Most common issue:** [e.g., "Latinate words with simpler Anglo-Saxon alternatives"]
- **Files reviewed:** [list]

**Quick wins:** [Simple patterns that appear multiple times and could be find-replaced]

## introduction.tex

### - [ ] Line 23: "utilize" → "use" (Anglo-Saxon over Latin)

**Comment:**
"Utilize" is pretentious Latinism. "Use" is simpler, clearer Anglo-Saxon word that means the same thing. No technical distinction justifies the fancier word here.

**Original:**
```
We utilize administrative data from the IRS to construct our sample.
```

**Proposed Revision:**
```
We use administrative data from the IRS to construct our sample.
```

**Why better:** One syllable beats three. Simpler, clearer, more direct. McCloskey's principle: Anglo-Saxon over Latin.

---

### - [ ] Lines 45-47: Vague nouns ("structure", "process") → be specific

**Comment:**
"Structure" and "process" are vague fillers adding no meaning. McCloskey flags these as empty words. Be specific about what structure or process, or delete entirely.

**Original:**
```
The structure of the analysis follows a standard process for examining
the factors that drive behavioral responses.
```

**Proposed Revision:**
```
We first document behavioral patterns, then test whether policy knowledge
drives the responses.
```

**Why better:** Eliminates vague nouns, says specifically what the analysis does, active verbs ("document", "test"), concrete actions.

---

### - [ ] Lines 78-81: Weak verb "examine" → specific action

**Comment:**
"Examine" is overused weak verb. Say specifically what you do: test, estimate, compare, show. Cochrane: be concrete about methods.

**Original:**
```
We examine the relationship between EITC knowledge and labor supply.
```

**Proposed Revision:**
```
We estimate how EITC knowledge affects labor supply.
```

**Why better:** "Estimate" is specific action (econometrics), "affects" is clearer than "relationship", more direct.

---

[Repeat for all suggestions]

---

## High-Priority Patterns

### Pattern: "utilize" appears 12 times → replace all with "use"

**Instances:**
- Line 23: "We utilize administrative data..."
- Line 67: "The model utilizes variation in..."
- Line 102: "Our approach utilizes geographic differences..."
[List all 12]

**Action:** Find-replace "utilize" → "use" throughout (verify each makes sense).

---

### Pattern: Vague nouns (structure, process, concept, situation)

**Instances:**
- Line 45: "structure of the analysis"
- Line 89: "estimation process"
- Line 134: "the concept of elasticity"

**Action:** Delete or replace with specific description.

---

## Word Choice Statistics

**By category:**
- Anglo-Saxon vs. Latin: [N] suggestions (e.g., utilize→use, commence→begin)
- Concrete vs. Abstract: [N] suggestions (e.g., "poor places" vs. "economically disadvantaged regions")
- Vague nouns: [N] instances (structure, process, concept, etc.)
- Weak verbs: [N] instances (examine, analyze, investigate)
- Useless adjectives: [N] instances (various, certain, particular)
- Useless adverbs: [N] instances (very, clearly, obviously)

**Most frequently flagged:**
1. "utilize" (12 instances) → "use"
2. "individuals" (8 instances) → "people"
3. "examine" (7 instances) → specific verbs

---

## Overall Assessment

**Strengths:**
- [What's working well - e.g., "Good use of concrete examples in results section"]

**Main patterns to address:**
1. [Primary issue - e.g., "Latinate words throughout - consistent use of 'utilize', 'demonstrate', 'implement'"]
2. [Secondary - e.g., "Vague nouns weakening precision"]
3. [Tertiary - e.g., "Weak verbs where specific actions clearer"]

**Estimated impact:**
Addressing these word choices will make writing ~20% more concise and significantly more direct/punchy.
```

---

## General Formatting Guidelines

### Universal Checklist Format (All Tasks Except Grammar)

**Required structure for each suggestion:**

```
### - [ ] Lines X-Y: [Brief description]

**Comment:**
[Explain the issue - why it's problematic, what pattern it represents, how it flags as AI or weakens writing]

**Original:**
```
[Quote original text with enough context]
```

**Proposed Revision:**
```
[Complete revision addressing all issues]
```

**Why better:** [Explain improvements concretely]
```

**Key principles:**
1. **Checkbox mandatory** - `- [ ]` allows user to mark implemented changes with `X`
2. **Comment first** - Explain the issue before showing text
3. **Original → Proposed** - Always show both for comparison
4. **Why better** - Justify the change

### Grammar Task Exception

Grammar uses **concise log format** (no checklists):
- `**Line X:** [previous] → [new]`
- Corrections applied directly to .tex files
- Log documents what changed, doesn't request approval

**Rationale:** Grammar fixes are objective errors, not stylistic choices.

### Line References
- Use "Lines X-Y" or "Line X" format consistently
- Include brief description in checklist item
- Include section context in Comment if helpful

### Code Blocks
- Use triple backticks for Original and Proposed Revision
- Preserve original formatting/indentation
- Don't include line numbers in code blocks
- **CRITICAL: Show COMPLETE sentences** — never truncate mid-sentence
  - Include the full sentence(s) containing the issue
  - If the change spans multiple sentences, show all affected sentences
  - Add one sentence of context before/after if needed for clarity
  - This enables batch application via `apply_marked.prompt`

**Correct (full sentence):**
```
**Original:**
We utilize administrative data from the IRS to construct our sample.

**Proposed Revision:**
We use administrative data from the IRS to construct our sample.
```

**Incorrect (fragment):**
```
**Original:**
utilize administrative data

**Proposed Revision:**
use administrative data
```

### Comments (Issue Descriptions)
- Start with the problem
- Explain WHY it's problematic (mechanism)
- Connect to broader patterns (AI tells, field conventions, McCloskey principles)
- Be specific and actionable

### Proposed Revisions
- Must address ALL identified issues in the Comment
- Show complete revised version, not fragments
- Preserve technical content while improving style
- Don't introduce new problems

### "Why Better" Explanations
- Detail WHAT changed (concrete transformations)
- Explain WHY it's better (principles applied)
- Show HOW it improves reader experience
- Connect to writing authorities when relevant (Cochrane, McCloskey, field norms)

# Senior Referee Report
**Date:** [date]
**Reviewer:** Senior Referee (Contribution Focus)
**Paper Type:** Type [A/B/C/D]

---

## DESK REJECTION DECISION

**[DESK REJECT / SEND TO REVIEW]**

**Rationale:**
[One paragraph explaining why paper does/doesn't meet AER bar for peer review based on contribution significance, scope, and clarity]

---

## CONTRIBUTION ASSESSMENT

### Core Contribution (One Sentence):
[State what the paper claims to contribute in one clear sentence]

### Evaluation of Significance:

**Importance of Question:**
[Does this matter? To whom? Why should general economists care?]

**Magnitude of Advance:**
[Is this a major step forward, modest refinement, or incremental extension?]

**Novelty:**
[What specifically is new versus existing literature? Is novelty claim accurate?]

**Broad Relevance:**
[Would this interest general AER readership, or only narrow specialists?]

### Contribution Verdict:
[Does this represent a significant advance that AER should publish? Or is contribution too incremental/narrow/unclear?]

---

## LITERATURE POSITIONING ASSESSMENT

### Accuracy of Positioning:
[Do authors correctly characterize what's novel? Or are they overclaiming/missing related work?]

### Specific Gaps or Overclaims:

1. **[Issue]**: [E.g., "Paper X from JPE 2021 already shows this relationship for similar context"]
   - Impact: [How this affects novelty claim]
   - Recommendation: [What authors should do]

2. [Additional issues if any]

### Literature Command:
[Do authors demonstrate genuine understanding of related work? Fair engagement? Recent citations?]

---

## PRESENTATION & ACCESSIBILITY

**Can a general economist understand this contribution?**

[Assessment of whether introduction clearly conveys the contribution, whether technical material is appropriately balanced, whether non-specialists can appreciate the advance]

**Major presentation issues obscuring contribution:**
[Only note if presentation problems prevent judging merit - this is not line-by-line copyediting]

---

## MAJOR CONCERNS

**Substantive issues affecting publishability (contribution-focused):**

1. **[Primary concern]**: [E.g., "Contribution claim rests on X, but existing Paper Y already establishes this"]
   - Why this matters: [Impact on publication decision]
   - Path forward: [What would address this - if anything]

2. **[Secondary concern]**: [E.g., "Missing engagement with Z literature changes positioning"]
   - Why this matters: [Impact on contribution significance]
   - Path forward: [Specific recommendation]

[Continue for all major concerns]

---

## RECOMMENDATION

**[REJECT / MAJOR REVISIONS / MINOR REVISIONS / ACCEPT]**

### Justification:
[One paragraph explaining recommendation based on contribution magnitude, novelty accuracy, and scope]

### What Would Strengthen Contribution (if applicable):
1. [Specific suggestion - e.g., "Reframe contribution as methodological rather than substantive"]
2. [E.g., "Engage seriously with Literature X which challenges novelty claim"]
3. [E.g., "Provide clearer statement of general insight beyond specific setting"]

---

## PAPER TYPE-SPECIFIC NOTES

**[Type A/B/C/D]-Specific Assessment:**
[Apply paper type-specific evaluation priorities from overlay]

**Key consideration for this type:**
[E.g., for Type A: "Familiar topic requires genuinely surprising finding - is magnitude unexpected?"]
[E.g., for Type B: "Does this transcend institutional setting to teach general economists something?"]

**Paper Type:** Type [A/B/C/D]

---

## METHODOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT

### Research Design:
[Summarize the identification strategy or methodological approach]

### Credibility Assessment:
**Do I believe these results?**

[Overall judgment: Are identification assumptions plausible? Are methods rigorous? Are results credible?]

**Main threats to validity:**
1. [Threat 1 - e.g., "Parallel trends assumption"]
2. [Threat 2 - e.g., "Selection into treatment"]
3. [Additional threats]

---

## IDENTIFICATION CONCERNS (Primary Focus)

**Major identification issues:**

### 1. **[Most serious concern]**: [E.g., "Parallel trends assumption seems implausible"]

**Why this matters:**
[Explain the threat to causal interpretation - what alternative explanation does this enable?]

**Evidence that would address it:**
- [Specific test - e.g., "Event study showing no pre-trends"]
- [Alternative check - e.g., "Balance tests on observables"]
- [Additional evidence needed]

**Current status:**
[What authors have shown vs. what's missing]

---

### 2. **[Second concern]**: [E.g., "Exclusion restriction requires X, but Y could violate it"]

**Why this matters:**
[Alternative channel this opens, impact on causal claims]

**Evidence that would address it:**
- [Specific evidence needed]
- [Tests to rule out alternative channel]

**Current status:**
[Assessment of what's provided]

---

[Continue for all major identification concerns]

---

## ROBUSTNESS GAPS

**Missing robustness checks:**

### 1. **[Most important missing check]**: [E.g., "Event study to verify parallel trends"]

**Why needed:**
[What assumption or threat does this test?]

**What should be shown:**
[Specific expectation - e.g., "Flat pre-period coefficients, sharp break at treatment"]

---

### 2. **[Second missing check]**: [E.g., "Sensitivity to bandwidth in RD"]

**Why needed:**
[What would this reveal about result robustness?]

**What should be shown:**
[Expected analysis]

---

[Continue for important missing checks]

### Fragility Concerns:
[Are results robust across shown specifications, or do they depend on specific choices? Any evidence of specification sensitivity?]

---

## DATA & IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES

**Data Quality:**
[Are data adequate? Measurement concerns? Sample construction appropriate?]

**Implementation:**
[Are statistical methods appropriate? Standard errors correct? Any computational concerns?]

**Transparency:**
[Can this be replicated? Are choices well-documented?]

---

## MAJOR CONCERNS

**Issues affecting credibility (numbered by severity):**

1. **[Fatal flaw if exists]**: [E.g., "Identification assumption clearly violated by X"]
   - Classification: **Fatal / Serious / Important gap**
   - Required fix: [What's needed to address]

2. **[Serious concern]**: [E.g., "No balance tests for quasi-experiment"]
   - Classification: **Fatal / Serious / Important gap**
   - Required fix: [Specific tests needed]

3. [Continue]

---

## RECOMMENDATION

**[REJECT / MAJOR REVISIONS / MINOR REVISIONS / ACCEPT]**

### Justification:
[One paragraph explaining recommendation based on identification credibility and robustness comprehensiveness]

### Required to Establish Credibility:
1. [Highest priority - e.g., "Show event study with no pre-trends"]
2. [Second priority - e.g., "Demonstrate robustness to alternative specifications"]
3. [Third priority - e.g., "Provide balance tests for treatment/control"]

### Optional but Recommended:
- [Additional checks that would strengthen but aren't required]

---

## PAPER TYPE-SPECIFIC NOTES

**[Type A/B/C/D]-Specific Assessment:**
[Apply paper type-specific methods priorities from overlay]

**Key consideration for this type:**
[E.g., for Type A: "Identification is THE central concern - demand comprehensive robustness"]
[E.g., for Type D: "Which parameters identified vs. imposed? Sensitivity to calibration?"]

---

## SUMMARY

[2-3 paragraph overall assessment synthesizing: identification credibility, robustness comprehensiveness, data quality, and final recommendation with specific requirements for establishing credibility]

2. [Continue]

---

## IV. SYNTHESIZED RECOMMENDATION

**[REJECT / MAJOR REVISIONS / MINOR REVISIONS / ACCEPT]**

### Rationale:
[Synthesize both perspectives into unified justification]

**Contribution assessment** [from senior]: [Verdict]

**Methods assessment** [from junior]: [Verdict]

**Overall**: [Integrated recommendation explaining how both dimensions lead to decision]

### What's Needed for Acceptance (if applicable):

**Priority 1**: [Typically most serious concern from either referee]
**Priority 2**: [Second most serious]
**Priority 3**: [Third]

[If both have major concerns]: Both contribution framing and methodological rigor need strengthening. [Explain which to address first or whether parallel work possible]

[If one strong, one weak]: The [contribution/methods] [is strong/shows promise]. Focus revisions on [the weak dimension].

---

## V. AREAS OF AGREEMENT & DISAGREEMENT

### Both Referees Agree (Highest Priority):
- [Issue both flagged - these are most important to address]
- [Additional shared concerns]

### Senior Emphasizes, Junior Less Concerned:
- [E.g., "Senior questions contribution significance; junior focused on methods assuming contribution important"]

### Junior Emphasizes, Senior Less Concerned:
- [E.g., "Junior has serious identification concerns; senior finds contribution potentially significant if methods strengthened"]

### No Major Disagreements:
[If referees aligned, note this and explain implications]

---

## SUMMARY

[3-4 paragraph overall assessment that:]
- Synthesizes both referee perspectives
- Explains recommendation with integrated reasoning
- Provides clear path forward (if revisions recommended)
- Maintains constructive, collegial tone
```

## Format Requirements for Referee Reports

### Professional Review Format (Not Checklist)

**Key differences from other output files:**

1. **No checkboxes** - These are evaluative reports, not suggestion lists
2. **Professional tone** - Write as expert colleague, not adversary
3. **Structured sections** - Follow template hierarchy strictly
4. **Synthesis for combined** - When both referees run, create unified narrative
5. **Specific recommendations** - Don't just say "weak" - explain exactly what's needed

### Tone Guidelines

**Be:**
- Rigorous but constructive
- Specific (cite exact concerns, papers, evidence needed)
- Direct about problems but respectful
- Clear about fatal flaws vs. fixable issues

**Avoid:**
- Vague criticism ("identification is weak")
- Adversarial language
- Impossible demands
- Overlooking good work

### Evidence and Specificity

**Good:** "Parallel trends assumption seems implausible because treatment group cities were experiencing faster growth pre-treatment (Figure 2 shows upward trend). Event study is essential."

**Bad:** "Identification concerns. Need more robustness."

### File Naming

- Senior only: `notes/senior_referee_report.md`
- Junior only: `notes/junior_referee_report.md`
- Both (synthesized): `notes/referee_report.md`

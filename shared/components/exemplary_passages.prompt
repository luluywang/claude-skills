## 1. OPENING WITH CONCRETE SCALE (Type A)

### Example: Financial Advisor Misconduct (Egan, Matvos, Seru 2017)

**Abstract opening:**
> "We construct a novel database containing the universe of financial advisers in the United States from 2005 to 2015, representing approximately 10% of employment of the finance and insurance sector. We provide the first large-scale study that documents the economy-wide extent of misconduct among financial advisers and the associated labor market consequences of misconduct. Seven percent of advisers have misconduct records, and this share reaches more than 15% at some of the largest advisory firms. Roughly one third of advisers with misconduct are repeat offenders."

**Why it works:**
- Concrete numbers immediately: "650,000 advisers", "10% of employment", "7% have misconduct"
- Scale is vivid: "$30 trillion of investible assets"
- "First large-scale study" - clear contribution
- No throat-clearing about importance of financial advisers

**Introduction opening:**
> "American households rely on financial advisers for financial planning and transaction services. Over 650,000 registered financial advisers in the United States help manage over $30 trillion of investible assets, and represent approximately 10% of total employment of the finance and insurance sector (NAICS 52; Coen 2015)."

**Principle:** Lead with concrete scale, not abstract importance. Numbers are memorable.

## 2. THEORY-DATA INTEGRATION (Type D)

### Example: Banking Runs (Egan, Hortaçsu, Matvos 2015)

**Abstract:**
> "We develop a structural empirical model of the U.S. banking sector. Insured depositors and run-prone uninsured depositors choose between differentiated banks. Banks compete for deposits and endogenously default. The estimated demand for uninsured deposits declines with banks' financial distress, which is not the case for insured deposits. We calibrate the supply side of the model. The calibrated model possesses multiple equilibria with bank-run features, suggesting that banks can be very fragile."

**Why it works:**
- Model → Estimation → Prediction → Finding, all in abstract
- Testable prediction clearly stated
- Economic magnitude: "capital requirement below 18% can lead to significant instability"

**Introduction with stylized fact:**
> "Figure 1 suggests that financial distress of banks affects their ability to attract uninsured deposits. We plot the relationship between the uninsured deposit market shares and financial distress for Citi Bank and JPMorgan Chase from 2005 through 2010. As distress of Citi Bank increases relative to JPMorgan, Citi's market share of uninsured deposits decreases and JPMorgan's market share increases (Panel A). Note that the market shares of insured deposits, which should be insensitive to distress, show no such relationship (Panel B)."

**Principle:** Show stylized fact (Figure 1) BEFORE developing theory. Empirical puzzle motivates model.

## 3. METHODOLOGICAL INNOVATION INTRODUCTION (Type C)

### Example: Innovation Measurement (Kogan, Papanikolaou, Seru, Stoffman 2017 QJE)

**Opening:**
> "We propose a new measure of the economic importance of each innovation. Our measure uses newly collected data on patents issued to U.S. firms in the 1926 to 2010 period, combined with the stock market response to news about patents. Our patent-level estimates of private economic value are positively related to the scientific value of these patents, as measured by the number of citations the patent receives in the future."

**Why it works:**
- "We propose" - direct, active voice
- Economic question implicit (measuring innovation importance)
- Method stated clearly in plain language: "stock market response to news"
- Connection to existing measure (citations) immediately

**Motivation before method:**
> "However, the predictions of these models are difficult to test directly, mainly because of the scarcity of directly observable measures of technological innovation. To assess the importance of technological innovation for economic growth, an ideal measure should capture the economic value of new inventions and be comparable both across industries and across time. This article aims to fill this gap by constructing a new measure of the economic importance of each innovation."

**Principle:** State why existing methods fail BEFORE introducing innovation. Create space for contribution.

## 4. SPECIALIZED TOPIC EXPLANATION (Type B)

### Example: Shadow Banking (Buchak, Matvos, Piskorski, Seru 2018 NBER)

**Abstract explaining institutions concretely:**
> "Bank balance sheet lending is commonly viewed as the predominant form of lending. We document and study two margins of adjustment that are usually absent from this view using microdata in the $10 trillion U.S. residential mortgage market. We first document the limits of the shadow bank substitution margin: shadow banks substitute for traditional—deposit-taking—banks in loans which are easily sold, but are limited from activities requiring on-balance-sheet financing. We then document the balance sheet retention margin: banks switch between traditional balance sheet lending and selling loans based on their balance sheet strength, behaving more like shadow banks following negative shocks."

**Why it works:**
- Defines concepts concretely: "deposit-taking banks" vs. "shadow banks"
- Concrete scale: "$10 trillion U.S. residential mortgage market"
- Plain language: "easily sold" not "highly liquid securitizable assets"
- Economic mechanism clear: banks switch behavior based on balance sheet strength

**Principle:** Explain specialized institutions in service of economic mechanism, with concrete scale.

## 5. INVERTED PYRAMID STRUCTURE

### Example: MRW Growth Paper (Mankiw, Romer, Weil 1992 QJE)

**Abstract:**
> "This paper examines whether the Solow growth model is consistent with the international variation in the standard of living. It shows that an augmented Solow model that includes accumulation of human as well as physical capital provides an excellent description of the cross-country data."

**Why it works:**
- Two sentences: (1) question, (2) answer
- No literature review in abstract
- "Excellent description" - confident claim when warranted
- Readers know contribution in 10 seconds

**Introduction opening:**
> "This paper takes Robert Solow seriously. In his classic 1956 article Solow proposed that we begin the study of economic growth by assuming a standard neoclassical production function with decreasing returns to capital."

**Why it works:**
- Memorable opening: "takes Robert Solow seriously"
- No throat-clearing
- Subject-verb-object clarity
- Sets up contribution by positioning against Solow

## 6. CONCRETE BEFORE ABSTRACT

### Example: EITC Paper (Chetty, Friedman, Saez)

**Abstract:**
> "We estimate the impacts of the Earned Income Tax Credit on labor supply using local variation in knowledge about the EITC schedule. We proxy for EITC knowledge in a ZIP code with the fraction of individuals who manipulate reported self-employment income to maximize their EITC refund."

**Why it works:**
- Identification strategy in abstract (unusual but effective for Type A)
- Concrete measure: "fraction who manipulate" not "propensity for optimization"
- Geographic specificity: "ZIP code" not "local area"

**Later, concrete example:**
> "For example, 6.5 percent of EITC claimants in Chicago, IL in 2008 are self-employed and report earnings exactly at the refund-maximizing level, compared with 0.6 percent in Rapid City, SD."

**Principle:** "Chicago vs. Rapid City" beats "geographic heterogeneity." Specific > general.

## 7. ADVERTISING PRICING (Gentzkow et al. 2023)

**Abstract:**
> "Existing theories of media competition imply that advertisers will pay a lower price in equilibrium to reach consumers who multi-home across competing outlets. We generalize, extend, and test this prediction. We find that television outlets whose viewers watch more television charge a lower price per impression to advertisers."

**Why it works:**
- Theory prediction → Test → Finding, all in 3 sentences
- Plain language: "multi-home" defined by context
- Concrete finding: "watch more television charge lower price"
- Theory serves empirics, not vice versa

## 8. AVOIDING OVER-EXPLANATION

### Financial Advisor Misconduct (Type A - intuitive topic)

**What they DON'T do:**
- Don't explain why financial advisers matter (readers know)
- Don't explain what misconduct is philosophically
- Don't motivate why trust matters for markets

**What they DO:**
- Jump to scale: "650,000 advisers, $30 trillion"
- State contribution: "first large-scale study"
- Give concrete findings: "7% have misconduct, 15% at largest firms"

**Contrast with Type B paper (Shadow Banking):**
- DOES explain what shadow banks are (readers don't know)
- DOES provide institutional detail ("deposit-taking" vs. "shadow")
- DOES give concrete scale ($10 trillion market)

**Principle:** Type A = minimize motivation. Type B = explain institutions. Adjust for audience knowledge.

## 9. ACTIVE VOICE AND RESPONSIBILITY

### Kogan et al. (strong examples)

> "We propose a new measure..."
> "We construct this measure combining..."
> "We find that our measure is associated with..."

**Not:**
> "A new measure is proposed..."
> "It is found that the measure is associated with..."

### MRW

> "This paper takes Robert Solow seriously."
> "We show that..."

**Principle:** Take responsibility. Use "I" or "We" for claims and methods.

---

## 10. PLAIN LANGUAGE FOR COMPLEX IDEAS

### Banking Runs - explaining institutional feature

**Good:**
> "Uninsured deposits are frequently lost in cases of bank default, and are therefore potentially prone to runs."

**Why it works:**
- "Frequently lost" - plain language
- "Prone to runs" - technical term but intuitive
- Causal connection clear

### Shadow Banking - explaining mechanism

**Good:**
> "Banks switch between traditional balance sheet lending and selling loans based on their balance sheet strength, behaving more like shadow banks following negative shocks."

**Why it works:**
- "Switch between" - simple verb
- "Following negative shocks" - causal language clear
- No jargon needed to explain behavior

## 11. HANDLING MULTIPLE CONTRIBUTIONS

### Financial Advisor Misconduct - three contributions stated clearly

**Abstract structure:**
> "We provide the first large-scale study that documents the economy-wide extent of misconduct among financial advisers and financial advisory firms. We examine the labor market consequences of misconduct for financial advisers and study adviser allocation across firms following misconduct. Lastly, we provide an explanation that is consistent with the facts we document."

**Three contributions:**
1. Document extent (descriptive)
2. Labor market consequences (causal)
3. Explanation (mechanism)

**Principle:** Multiple contributions are fine if stated clearly and sequentially.

## 12. CITING SPECIFIC NUMBERS, NOT ABSTRACTIONS

### Financial Advisor
- "650,000 advisers" not "many advisers"
- "$30 trillion" not "substantial assets"
- "7% have misconduct" not "significant fraction"

### Shadow Banking
- "$10 trillion mortgage market" not "large market"
- "18% capital requirement" not "higher requirements"

### Banking Runs
- "half of deposits are uninsured" not "substantial portion"
- "three quarters of funding" not "most funding"

**Principle:** Every magnitude should be quantified.

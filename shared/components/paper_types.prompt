# Paper Type Taxonomy & Diagnostics

## Why Paper Type Matters

Economics papers are heterogeneous. A Chetty paper about neighborhood effects uses concepts everyone understands (neighborhoods, kids, income). A Gentzkow paper about media bias or a Keys paper about securitization requires explaining specialized institutional details that most readers don't know.

**The writing challenge depends on your paper type:**
- **Intuitive topic + complex method** → Spend time on identification, less on motivation
- **Specialized topic + standard method** → Spend time explaining institutions, concepts
- **Technical innovation** → Balance explaining the innovation with showing why it matters
- **Broad audience appeal** → Minimize jargon, maximize concrete examples

## The Four Main Paper Types

### Type A: Intuitive Topic, Complex Identification
**Examples:** Chetty's neighborhood mobility work, EITC labor supply papers, education interventions, financial advisor misconduct (Egan, Matvos, Seru 2017)

**Characteristics:**
- Outcome people care about (income, education, health)
- Challenge is credible identification, not explaining what you're measuring
- Can motivate quickly ("Does neighborhood matter for kids?")
- Institutional details serve identification strategy

**Writing priorities:**
1. **Get to the research design fast** - readers understand the question, want to know how you answer it
2. **Explain identification clearly in plain language** - this is your contribution
3. **Minimize background** - don't over-explain what neighborhoods are
4. **Concrete examples of variation** - "Chicago vs. Rapid City" not "geographic heterogeneity"
5. **Translate magnitudes** - "moving from 25th to 75th percentile neighborhood increases income by 12%" not "coefficient of 0.23"

**What to avoid:**
- Long motivation about why education/health/income matters (readers know)
- Excessive institutional background (get to the natural experiment)
- Technical jargon for familiar concepts ("human capital accumulation" → "kids' later earnings")

---

### Type B: Specialized Topic, Readers Need Context
**Examples:** Securitization papers, advertising pricing, media bias, specific financial instruments

**Characteristics:**
- Institutional details most readers don't know
- Need to explain the context before the question makes sense
- Market structure, regulations, or industry practices matter
- Risk of losing readers in institutional weeds

**Writing priorities:**
1. **Lead with the economic question** - before institutional details
2. **Explain institutions concretely** - "loans are bundled and sold to investors" not "asset-backed securitization"
3. **One institutional detail at a time** - don't dump everything in intro
4. **Connect institutions to economic mechanism** - explain WHY the institution matters for behavior
5. **Use specific examples** - "$3.6 trillion in 2006" not "substantial growth"
6. **Visual aids help** - figures showing institutional features

**What to avoid:**
- Assuming readers know specialized institutions
- Jargon without definition ("MBS," "CDO" without explanation)
- Institutional details that don't matter for your argument
- Front-loading all institutional background before research question

**Key principle:** Explain institutions in service of economic mechanism, not for their own sake.

---

### Type C: Methodological Innovation
**Examples:** New econometric technique, novel measurement approach, new identification strategy

**Characteristics:**
- Main contribution is HOW you answer a question, not just what you find
- Need to explain why existing methods don't work
- Risk of getting too technical too fast
- Must balance methodological detail with economic substance

**Writing priorities:**
1. **State economic question first** - method serves the question
2. **Explain limitation of existing approach** - creates space for your innovation
3. **Intuition before math** - explain the idea in words first
4. **Simple example/special case** - show how it works in transparent setting
5. **Economic interpretation of results** - don't let method overshadow substance
6. **Robustness to show it's not just a trick** - method should generalize

**What to avoid:**
- Leading with technical innovation before economic question
- Excessive generality ("consider a general shock process...then we specialize")
- Math without intuition
- Making the method seem more complex than it is
- "Illustrative" empirical work (either do real work or none)

---

### Type D: Theory Paper Applied to Data
**Examples:** Testing specific theoretical predictions, structural estimation, banking runs (Egan, Hortaçsu, Matvos 2015), growth empirics (Mankiw, Romer, Weil 1992)

**Characteristics:**
- Theory generates testable predictions
- Empirics assess which theory fits
- Challenge is keeping theory tractable while realistic enough to test
- Need to map theory to observables clearly

**Writing priorities:**
1. **Motivate with empirical puzzle or question** - not abstract theory
2. **Simplest model that delivers testable predictions** - not most general
3. **Clear mapping from theory to data** - readers should see connection
4. **Discuss alternative theories** - what predictions distinguish them?
5. **Economic interpretation** - not just "the model fits"
6. **Show stylized facts** - patterns in data, not just test statistics

**What to avoid:**
- General model you then specialize for empirics
- Theory for theory's sake (if paper doesn't expand theory, minimize it)
- Predictions that are obvious or unfalsifiable
- Losing empirical findings in theoretical complexity
- Tests that can't distinguish between theories

## Diagnostic Questions: What Type Is Your Paper?

Ask yourself:

**1. Can a smart undergrad understand your research question without specialized knowledge?**
- YES → Type A (intuitive topic)
- NO → Type B (specialized topic) or Type C (methodological)

**2. What's your main contribution?**
- Novel identification strategy for familiar outcome → Type A
- Understanding of specialized institution/market → Type B
- New method or measurement → Type C
- Testing theoretical predictions → Type D

**3. What do readers need most?**
- Believe your identification → Type A (focus on research design)
- Understand the institution → Type B (explain context clearly)
- Understand your method → Type C (intuition before math)
- See theory maps to data → Type D (clear predictions)

**4. Where will readers get stuck?**
- "How do you know it's causal?" → Type A
- "What is this institution/market?" → Type B
- "How does this method work?" → Type C
- "Why this model?" → Type D

## Type-Specific Writing Guidance Summary

| Paper Type | Lead With | Spend Time On | Minimize | Key Risk |
|------------|-----------|---------------|----------|----------|
| **Type A: Intuitive Topic** | Research question | Identification strategy | Motivation, background | Over-explaining familiar concepts |

## Mixed Types

Many papers combine types. In these cases, identify the **primary type** (main contribution) and **secondary type** (supporting characteristic).

### Common Hybrid Patterns

#### Type C+B: Methodological Innovation + Specialized Institutions
**Example:** Shadow Banking (Buchak, Matvos, Piskorski, Seru 2018)
- **Primary:** Methodological (structural model with dual margins of adjustment)
- **Secondary:** Specialized topic (shadow banking vs. traditional banking institutions)

**Writing challenge:**
- Must explain BOTH the methodological innovation AND the institutional setting
- Economic question first, institutions second, method third
- Keep institutional explanation concrete before diving into model details
- Show method applies to real institutional features (not toy example)

**Structure:**
1. Economic question (credit market behavior)
2. Institutional context (shadow banks vs. traditional banks - concrete definitions)
3. Methodological innovation (dual margins model - intuition first)
4. Application to $10 trillion mortgage market

---

#### Type C+A: Methodological Innovation + Intuitive Application
**Example:** Innovation Measurement (Kogan, Papanikolaou, Seru, Stoffman 2017)
- **Primary:** Methodological (new measure of innovation value using stock returns)
- **Secondary:** Intuitive application (innovation's role in growth - familiar question)

**Writing challenge:**
- Don't over-explain why innovation matters (Type A characteristic)
- DO explain why existing measures fail (Type C requirement)
- Balance methodological rigor with accessible application
- Show measure works on familiar economic questions

**Structure:**
1. Economic question (measuring innovation importance for growth)
2. Limitation of existing measures (citations don't capture economic value)
3. Methodological innovation (stock market response - intuition clear)
4. Application to growth and reallocation questions

---

#### Type B+A: Specialized Topic + Intuitive Identification
**Example:** Advertising Pricing (Gentzkow et al. 2023)
- **Primary:** Specialized topic (media competition and multi-homing)
- **Secondary:** Clear empirical strategy

**Writing challenge:**
- Explain media market institutions clearly
- But don't bury empirical strategy in institutional details
- Multi-homing concept needs explanation (Type B)
- Empirical test should be straightforward once institutions clear

**Structure:**
1. Economic question + theory prediction
2. Institutional context (multi-homing behavior - defined concretely)
3. Empirical strategy
4. Findings

---

#### Type D+A: Theory + Data with Clear Identification
**Example:** Banking Runs (Egan, Hortaçsu, Matvos 2015)
- **Primary:** Theory + empirics (testing Diamond-Dybvig mechanisms)
- **Secondary:** Novel identification using deposit flows

**Writing challenge:**
- Motivate with stylized facts (show Citi vs. JPMorgan deposit patterns)
- Theory motivated by empirical puzzle, not abstraction
- Identification strategy clear (demand estimation)
- Show multiple equilibria exist quantitatively

**Structure:**
1. Stylized fact (Figure 1: uninsured deposits flee distressed banks)
2. Theory (Diamond-Dybvig with deposit competition)
3. Empirical strategy (structural demand estimation)
4. Findings (multiple equilibria possible, capital requirements)

### Guidelines for Hybrid Papers

**Determining Primary vs. Secondary Type:**

Ask: "What's my main contribution?"
- If it's the METHOD: Primary = Type C
- If it's UNDERSTANDING AN INSTITUTION: Primary = Type B
- If it's TESTING THEORY QUANTITATIVELY: Primary = Type D
- If it's CREDIBLE CAUSAL ESTIMATE: Primary = Type A

Ask: "What's my secondary challenge?"
- Need to explain unfamiliar institutions? Secondary = Type B
- Applying to familiar question? Secondary = Type A
- Testing theoretical predictions? Secondary = Type D

**Exposition Ordering for Hybrids:**

General principle: **Lead with economic question, then build in order of what readers need to understand next.**

**For C+B (Method + Institutions):**
Economic question → Institutional context → Methodological innovation → Application

**For C+A (Method + Intuitive application):**
Economic question → Why existing methods fail → New method (intuition) → Application to familiar question

**For B+A (Institutions + Identification):**
Economic question → Institutional explanation → Identification strategy → Findings

**For D+A (Theory + Clear ID):**
Stylized facts → Theoretical puzzle → Model → Empirical strategy → Findings

### Examples by Hybrid Type

| Paper | Authors | Hybrid Type | Primary Contribution | Secondary Feature |
|-------|---------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Shadow Banking | Buchak et al. 2018 | C+B | Dual margins structural model | Shadow bank institutions |
| Innovation Measurement | Kogan et al. 2017 | C+A | Stock-return-based measure | Innovation's growth role (familiar) |
| Advertising Pricing | Gentzkow et al. 2023 | B+A | Multi-homing behavior in media | Clear empirical test |
| Banking Runs | Egan et al. 2015 | D+A | Quantifying run equilibria | Structural demand estimation |

---

## Mixed Type Summary

**Key Insight:** Hybrid papers require balancing multiple exposition challenges. Identify primary type for main emphasis, secondary type for supporting context.

**General principle:** Order your exposition by what readers need to understand first. Build from familiar to unfamiliar, concrete to abstract. Economic question ALWAYS comes first, regardless of type combination.

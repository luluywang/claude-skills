# Type B Paper Overlay: Specialized Topic Needing Context

**Paper Type:** Type B - Specialized topic where readers need institutional context

**Examples:** Securitization papers, advertising pricing, media bias, specific financial instruments

---

## Key Characteristics

- Institutional details most readers don't know
- Need to explain context before question makes sense
- Market structure, regulations, or industry practices matter
- Risk of losing readers in institutional weeds

---

## Task Modifications for Type B Papers

### AI Detection Task

**Additional patterns to flag:**

**Jargon without definition:**
- MBS, CDO, CLO without explanation
- Industry acronyms assumed known
- Technical terms unexplained

**Institution-dump paragraphs:**
- Front-loading all details before research question
- Multiple institutional features in single paragraph
- Details not connected to economic mechanism

**Over-technical explanations:**
- Assuming reader has industry expertise
- Legal/regulatory details without economic translation
- Institutional mechanics without "why it matters"

---

### Structure Task

**Type B priorities:**

**Introduction structure:**
- Lead with economic question (not institutional detail)
- Weave in institutional context as needed
- Don't dump all institutions upfront

**Ideal flow:**
1. Economic question
2. Brief institutional context (what reader needs to understand question)
3. Your approach
4. Key finding
5. More institutional detail as needed in body

**Check for problems:**
- All institutions explained before research question stated
- Assuming reader knows specialized market
- Missing concrete examples/scale ("$3.6 trillion")
- Institutional details that don't serve argument

**Section ordering:**
- Institutional setting section: keep focused, connect to mechanism
- Don't let institutions overwhelm empirics
- Visual aids (figures showing market structure) very helpful

---

### Methodology Task

**Type B-specific focus:**

**Institutional explanation:**
- Concrete language: "loans are bundled and sold to investors" not "asset-backed securitization"
- One detail at a time (layer in gradually)
- Connect each detail to economic behavior
- Specific examples with scale

**Check for:**
- Is institution explained before assumed known?
- Plain language before jargon?
- Connection to economic mechanism clear?
- Concrete examples provided?

**Balance:**
- Enough context that question makes sense
- Not so much that readers drown
- Each detail should serve the argument

---

### Senior Referee Task (Type B)

**Contribution evaluation priorities for Type B:**

**Central challenge: Does this transcend the specific institutional setting?**
- Type B papers must extract general economic insights from specialized contexts
- Scrutinize: Is contribution "we study market X" or "we learn Y about general phenomenon using market X"?
- Ask: Would I care about this if I don't care about the specific industry/policy/institution?

**Accessibility to general economists is critical:**
- Can associate editor (general economist) understand contribution without industry expertise?
- Assess introduction: Can you grasp the economic question before getting lost in institutions?
- Common problem: Contribution requires too much institutional knowledge to appreciate

**Literature positioning across fields:**
- Type B papers often connect specialized and general literatures
- Verify: Do authors position relative to BOTH specialized literature AND broader economic questions?
- Example: Securitization paper should connect to finance literature AND information/screening literature

**Specific evaluation questions:**
- Can I state the economic question without mentioning the specific institution?
- Does the institutional setting provide advantages for answering a general question (unique data, clean experiment, transparent mechanism)?
- Is the finding specific to this setting, or generalizable?
- Would this appear in an economics principles textbook, or just an industry manual?

**Desk rejection risks for Type B:**
- Contribution is purely descriptive of specialized setting
- Economic insights are obvious once institutions explained
- Paper reads like industry case study, not economics research
- Too specialized - only industry experts would care
- Authors assume reader familiarity with institutions

**What strengthens Type B contribution:**
- Clear statement of general economic question upfront
- Institutional setting enables answering question not possible elsewhere
- Findings have implications beyond the specific context
- Mechanisms are general, even if setting is specialized
- Paper teaches general economists something, not just specialists

**Presentation assessment for Type B:**
- Is economic question stated before institutional detail?
- Can non-specialist understand why this setting matters?
- Are findings framed in general terms, not just setting-specific?

### Junior Referee Task (Type B)

**Methods evaluation priorities for Type B:**

**Institutional features often serve identification:**
- Type B papers frequently exploit institutional rules, regulations, or market structures
- Scrutinize: Are institutional features accurately described? Can they be verified?
- Watch for: Authors using specialized knowledge to handwave identification concerns

**Specific identification considerations:**

**Policy/regulation-based identification:**
- Thresholds and discontinuities: Are cutoffs truly discontinuous? Manipulation concerns?
- Regulatory changes: Anticipated or surprise? Endogenous policy risk?
- Compliance vs. intent-to-treat: Which is estimated? Does it matter?

**Market structure-based identification:**
- Market rules: Are they enforced? Do participants comply?
- Institutional frictions: Real or assumed for modeling convenience?
- Selection into market: Who participates? Does this limit generalizability?

**Data from specialized sources:**
- Proprietary data: Can findings be verified? Red flag if not replicable
- Administrative data from industry: Data quality? Sample selection?
- Constructed measures: Are measurement choices justified or convenient?

**Required robustness checks for Type B:**
1. **Institutional details sensitivity**: Do results depend on specific institutional assumptions?
2. **Sample selection**: Does participation in market/program select on characteristics?
3. **Alternative explanations**: Could other institutional features explain patterns?
4. **Generalizability tests**: Does effect vary across sub-markets in predicted way?
5. **Measurement sensitivity**: Are results robust to alternative variable definitions?

**Red flags specific to Type B:**
- Institutional details used to justify identification without evidence
- "Industry practice is X" asserted without verification
- Results depend critically on unverified institutional claims
- Specialized knowledge used to dismiss alternative explanations
- Data sources cannot be accessed by others (replication impossible)

**Communication requirement:**
- Identification strategy must be understandable to general economist
- Don't hide behind institutional complexity
- Plain language explanation of why variation is exogenous
- Institutional features supporting identification should be documented/verified

**Assessment approach:**
- Assume contribution is important if setting enables unique identification (senior's job)
- Focus: Are institutional claims accurate? Is identification strategy sound?
- Ask: Could someone without industry knowledge verify these claims?
- Demand: Clear documentation of institutional features, not appeals to authority

## Type B Writing Priorities Summary

### Lead With:
- Economic question
- Brief concrete institutional explanation

### Spend Time On:
- Clear institutional explanation in plain language
- Connecting institutions to economic behavior
- Concrete examples and scale
- Visual aids

### Minimize:
- Jargon without definition
- Institutional details that don't matter for argument
- Assuming reader has industry knowledge

### Key Risk to Avoid:
- Losing readers in institutional weeds
- Jargon overload
- Institutions for their own sake (not serving mechanism)

---

## Specific Language Patterns for Type B

### Flag these:

**Unexplained jargon:**
- "MBS and CDOs proliferated" (define first)
- "Tranche structures affected..." (explain what tranches are)
- Industry acronyms without definition

**Institution-first ordering:**
- Starting with "The securitization market..." before economic question
- Paragraph 1: institutions, paragraph 3: research question
- Institutional detail before reader knows why it matters

**Missing scale/concreteness:**
- "Substantial growth" → "$3.6 trillion in 2006"
- "Many loans" → "75% of mortgages"
- "Typical structure" → "Three tranches: senior (80%), mezzanine (15%), equity (5%)"

### Encourage these:

**Plain language first:**
- "Securitization, converting illiquid assets into liquid securities, has grown..."
- Define in simple terms, then use technical term
- "Loans are bundled and sold to investors (securitization)"

**Economic mechanism connection:**
- "This transformed intermediaries' role from 'buy and hold' to 'buy and sell'"
- Explain WHY institution matters for behavior
- Connect structure to incentives

**Concrete examples:**
- "$3.6 trillion in 2006"
- "Senior tranches rated AAA paid LIBOR + 20bp"
- Real numbers, real examples

---

## Examples from Type B Papers

### Good Type B opening:
> "Securitization, converting illiquid assets into liquid securities, has grown tremendously in recent years, with the universe of securitized mortgage loans reaching $3.6 trillion in 2006. The option to sell loans to investors has transformed the traditional role of financial intermediaries in the mortgage market from 'buying and holding' to 'buying and selling.'"

**Why it works:**
- Defines securitization in first sentence (plain language)
- Concrete scale ($3.6T)
- Economic implication (incentive change)
- Institution → mechanism flow

## Red Flags for Type B Papers

- [ ] Jargon in first paragraph without definition
- [ ] Institutional details before research question
- [ ] Missing concrete scale/examples
- [ ] Institutions explained but not connected to mechanism
- [ ] Assuming reader knows specialized market
- [ ] No figures showing institutional structure
- [ ] Technical details that don't serve argument

If these patterns appear, they should be flagged and revised.

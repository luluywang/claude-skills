# Writing Style Standards

Consolidated style rules for writing tasks. Apply these when producing written output (drafting text, polishing prose, creating tables with annotations).

---

## Word Choice

### Anglo-Saxon Over Latin

| Replace | With |
|---------|------|
| utilize | use |
| commence | begin |
| demonstrate | show |
| facilitate | help |
| implement | use (or specific verb) |
| prior to | before |
| in order to | to |
| individuals | people |

**Test:** Would you say this word aloud to a friend?

### Concrete Over Abstract

More concrete is better:
- "Chicago" > "large cities" > "urban areas"
- "workers" > "labor" > "factor inputs"
- "7%" > "significant fraction"

**Singular more vivid than plural:** "A worker" vs "workers"

### Cut Vague Nouns

- "concept" → be specific
- "structure" → usually empty
- "process" → just name the action
- "factor" → "reason" or be specific

### Cut Weak Modifiers

**Adjectives:** "interesting", "various", "different", "certain", "particular"

**About your work:** Never "striking results", "very significant", "highly important"

**Adverbs:** "very", "clearly", "obviously", "essentially", "basically"

### Redundant Phrases

| Replace | With |
|---------|------|
| due to the fact that | because |
| in the event that | if |
| for the purpose of | to |
| with regard to | about |
| it is the case that | (delete) |

## AI Tell Avoidance

### Sentence Openers to Avoid

- "Additionally," / "Furthermore," / "Moreover," at sentence start
- "Critically, however" / "Notably," / "Importantly,"
- "This [noun] [verb]s" patterns ("This finding suggests...")
- "It is worth noting that..." / "It bears mentioning..."

### Structure Patterns to Avoid

- Em-dash overuse (multiple per paragraph)
- "One is... A second is... A third is..." enumeration
- Artificial three-item lists (padding to rule-of-three)
- "Not only... but also..." constructions
- "Despite these challenges..." openers
- "In conclusion / In summary / Overall" (formulaic endings)

### Language Patterns to Avoid

- "Our results suggest that" (when identification is credible, say "We find")
- "Is consistent with" (weak—be direct)
- Overuse of: "arguably," "potentially," "plausibly"
- "utilize" → always use "use"
- Nominalizations: "make a calculation" → "calculate"

### AI Vocabulary (flag when overused)

align, crucial, delve, elaborate, emphasize, enhance, enduring, foster, garner, highlight, intricate, interplay, pivotal, showcase, tapestry, underscore, leverage, robust, nuanced, multifaceted, comprehensive, facilitate

## Sentence Structure

### Vary Length

- Mix short punchy sentences with longer flowing ones
- Avoid 4+ consecutive sentences of 15-25 words
- Break monotonous rhythm with a short sentence

### Active Voice

**Use:** "We find" / "We show" / "The data reveal"

**Avoid:** "It is found that" / "It can be shown that" / "Results are presented"

### Subject-Verb-Object

Clear structure preferred. Take responsibility for claims.

---

## Economics Conventions

### Always Quantify

- "650,000 advisers" not "many advisers"
- "$30 trillion" not "substantial assets"
- "7% have misconduct" not "significant fraction"

### Technical Terms OK When Needed

- "Agents" when used technically in models (OK)
- "Agents" when "people" is clearer (flag)
- Standard abbreviations fine: OLS, IV, FE, DID, RD

### Confidence When Warranted

If identification is credible: "We find" not "Our results suggest"

If estimate is precise: State the number, not "approximately"

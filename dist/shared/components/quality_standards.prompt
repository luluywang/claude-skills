# Quality Standards for Analysis

## Analysis Depth Requirements

Each suggestion must include ALL of the following elements:

### 1. Context Quotation
- **Minimum:** 3-8 lines of context from the original text
- **Purpose:** Show the pattern, not just isolated sentences
- **Format:** Use code blocks for clear quotations
- Include enough surrounding text to see the full pattern

### 2. Issue Identification
- **Primary issue:** The main problem (most important)
- **Secondary issues:** Additional problems that compound the main issue
- **Category:** Clearly label the type of problem (e.g., "AI-tell: Formulaic language", "General: Wordiness")
- **Mechanism:** Explain EXACTLY WHY this is problematic

### 3. Complete Revision
- **Requirement:** Address ALL issues identified (both primary and secondary)
- **Not acceptable:** Partial fixes that leave some problems unresolved
- **Show the work:** Provide the complete revised version
- **Format:** Use code blocks for clarity

### 4. Explanation of Improvement
- **What was changed:** Specific transformations made
- **Why it's better:** How the revision improves the writing
- **Impact:** Effect on flow, clarity, naturalness, or expert tone
- **Reader experience:** How it changes what the reader experiences

## Coverage Requirements

### Comprehensive Analysis
- **No sections skipped:** Analyze EVERY section of EVERY file
- **Even "good" sections:** Look harder for subtle patterns
- **Depth over breadth:** Better to have fewer deep suggestions than many shallow ones
- **Systematic coverage:** Ensure all major files get attention

### Target Item Distribution

**For AI Punctuation & Structural Tells (ai_screen.md):**
- Total target: 40-50 items across all files
- Per major file: 5-8 detailed suggestions
- Focus: Punctuation patterns, sentence rhythm, structural tells

**For Comprehensive Writing Improvements (simplifications.md):**
- Total target: 80-100 items across all files
- Per major file: 10-15 detailed suggestions
- Focus: AI language tells + general simplifications

**Priority:** Quality over exact counts. Better to have 40 excellent suggestions than 50 mediocre ones.

## Output Organization

### File Ordering
**CRITICAL:** All output markdown files MUST organize findings in PAPER READING ORDER, not alphabetical order:

1. introduction.tex
2. institutional_setting.tex
3. payment_costs.tex
4. real_effects.tex
5. redistribution.tex
6. conclusion.tex
7. appendix_theory.tex
8. appendix_structural.tex
9. appendix_data.tex (if applicable)

**Rationale:** Reviewers read findings in the same sequence as the paper flows, making it easier to implement corrections while reading through the manuscript.

**DO NOT** use alphabetical filename order.

# Editor Letter Synthesis

Synthesize senior and junior referee reports into a unified editor letter with recommendation.

---

## Input

Read both referee reports to extract:
1. **Senior verdict** (Contribution: insufficient / unclear / sufficient)
2. **Junior verdict** (Methods: fatally flawed / needs substantial work / credible)
3. **Deal Breakers from senior report**
4. **Deal Breakers from junior report**

---

## Decision Matrix

| Senior (Contribution) | Junior (Methods) | Recommendation |
|----------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Insufficient | Any | **Reject** |
| Unclear | Any issues | **Reject** |
| Sufficient | Fatally flawed | **Reject** |
| Sufficient | Needs substantial work | **Reject** |
| Sufficient | Credible with minor gaps | **Major Revisions** (rare) |
| Sufficient | Credible | **Minor Revisions** or **Accept** |

**Key principle:** Unless BOTH contribution AND methods are strong, recommend rejection.

---

## Synthesized Recommendation Logic

### REJECT (Default)

Use when:
- Senior says contribution insufficient or unclear
- Junior says methods fatally flawed or need substantial work
- Either report has Deal Breakers
- "Has potential with major revisions" → REJECT (not Major Revisions)

**Integration approach:**
```
From contribution standpoint: [Senior's key concern]
From methodological standpoint: [Junior's key concern if applicable]
[If one dimension OK]: While [X is acceptable], [fatal flaw on other dimension] prevents publication.
```

### MAJOR REVISIONS (Rarely Used)

Use ONLY when:
- Contribution is clearly significant (Senior: sufficient)
- Methods are credible (Junior: credible)
- Only minor targeted gaps remain (no Deal Breakers from either report)

**DO NOT use for:** Papers with potential but significant work needed.

### MINOR REVISIONS / ACCEPT

Use when:
- Both referees find paper sound
- Issues are truly minor (presentation, clarifications)
- No Deal Breakers from either report

## Output File Naming

**Output file:** `{short_title}_{YYYYMMDD}_claude_editor_letter.tex`

Use same short_title and timestamp (YYYYMMDD) as the referee reports.

## Editor Letter Template

```latex
\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry}
\usepackage{setspace}\onehalfspacing
\usepackage{graphicx}
\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}\setlength{\parskip}{0.5em}

\begin{document}

Dear [Editor First Name],

Thank you for the opportunity to review MS [number], ``[Paper Title].'' [1-2 sentences: what the paper studies, the method/data, the headline finding.]

I recommend \textbf{[rejection / major revisions / minor revisions / acceptance]} because [1-2 sentences integrating both contribution and methods perspectives. Reference key Deal Breakers if rejecting.]

I attach two detailed referee reports: one focused on the contribution and literature positioning, and one focused on research design and methodology. [Optional: 1 sentence highlighting the most critical issue if relevant.]

I hope these comments are useful.

Sincerely,

**Copy signature image:** Before compiling, copy `Lulu_Wang_Signature.jpg` from `referee/components/` to the output directory.

## Handling Tensions Between Reports

| Scenario | Synthesis Approach |
|----------|-------------------|
| Senior rejects, junior says methods fine | "Good execution doesn't overcome limited novelty" → Reject |
| Senior says strong, junior has serious methods concerns | "Fix methods first, then resubmit" → Reject |
| Both have Deal Breakers | "Both contribution and methods need work" → Reject |
| Neither has Deal Breakers | Consider Major Revisions or Accept |

---

## Letter Writing Guidelines

1. **Keep it brief** - Editor letter is 1 page max
2. **Integrate perspectives** - Don't list senior and junior separately; synthesize
3. **Be decisive** - Clear recommendation with clear rationale
4. **Reference attached reports** - Detail is in the two referee reports
5. **No recommendation in referee reports** - Only editor letter contains recommendation

---

## Post-Synthesis Steps

After generating editor letter:

1. **Citation verification** - Run `components/citation_verification.prompt` on all three files
2. **AI detection screening** - Run `copyedit/tasks/ai_detection.prompt` on all three files
3. **Copy signature** - Ensure `Lulu_Wang_Signature.jpg` is in output directory

## Quality Checks

Before delivery, verify:
- [ ] Editor letter exists with clear recommendation
- [ ] Recommendation matches decision matrix logic
- [ ] Both referee reports are referenced in letter
- [ ] Signature image will be found at compile time
- [ ] All three files use same short_title prefix

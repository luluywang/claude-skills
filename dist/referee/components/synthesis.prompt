# Referee Report Synthesis

Synthesize senior and junior referee evaluations into a unified, coherent referee report.

---

## Synthesis Principles

1. **Integration, Not Juxtaposition**: Create unified evaluation, not concatenated reports
2. **Issues affecting BOTH contribution AND credibility are highest priority**
3. **Preserve distinct perspectives** (senior's "what", junior's "how") while unifying

---

## Decision Matrix

| Senior (Contribution) | Junior (Methods) | Recommendation |
|----------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Insufficient | Any | **Reject** |
| Sufficient but unclear | Any issues | **Reject** |
| Strong | Flawed or needs substantial work | **Reject** |
| Strong | Needs minor work only | **Major revisions** (rare) |
| Strong | Sound | **Minor revisions** or **Accept** |

**Key principle:** Unless BOTH dimensions are strong, recommend rejection.

---

## Output File Naming

**Generate a short title slug** from the paper title:
1. Take first 2-3 key words from paper title (skip articles like "The", "A", "An")
2. Convert to lowercase
3. Replace spaces with underscores
4. Keep only alphanumeric characters and underscores
5. Limit to ~30 characters

**Add timestamp:** Use today's date in YYYYMMDD format (e.g., 20251231).

**Examples:**
- "The Effect of Minimum Wage on Employment" (reviewed 2025-12-31) → `minimum_wage_employment_20251231`
- "Does Immigration Affect Wages? Evidence from..." (reviewed 2025-01-15) → `immigration_wages_20250115`
- "A Theory of Optimal Taxation" (reviewed 2025-03-01) → `optimal_taxation_20250301`

**File naming convention:**
- `{short_title}_{YYYYMMDD}_claude_editor_letter.tex`
- `{short_title}_{YYYYMMDD}_claude_referee_report.tex`

## Output Documents

Produce two LaTeX files:

### 1. Editor Letter (`{short_title}_{YYYYMMDD}_claude_editor_letter.tex`)

**Structure (1 page max):**
1. Salutation to editor by first name
2. Thank for opportunity to review (MS number + title), then paper summary (~1 paragraph)
3. Recommendation + rationale (~1 paragraph integrating both perspectives)
4. Closing + signature

```latex
\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry}
\usepackage{setspace}\onehalfspacing
\usepackage{graphicx}
\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}\setlength{\parskip}{0.5em}

\begin{document}

Dear [Editor First Name],

Thank you for the opportunity to review MS [number], ``[Title].'' The paper [~1 paragraph summary: what paper studies, method/data, headline finding].

I recommend [rejection / major revisions / minor revisions / acceptance] because [~1 paragraph: key reason integrating contribution and methods perspectives].

I hope these comments are useful.

Sincerely,

\end{document}
```

**Copy signature image:** Before compiling, copy `Lulu_Wang_Signature.jpg` from `referee/components/` to the output directory.

### 2. Referee Report (`{short_title}_{YYYYMMDD}_claude_referee_report.tex`)

**IMPORTANT:** Report does NOT include recommendation—that belongs only in editor letter.

**Structure:**
1. Summary of the Paper (1-2 paragraphs)
2. Major Comments (numbered subsections)
3. Minor Issues (bullet points)

```latex
\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry}
\usepackage{setspace}\onehalfspacing
\usepackage{amsmath,amssymb,hyperref}

\begin{document}
\title{Referee Report for ``[Title]''}
\author{MS [number]}
\date{}
\maketitle

\section{Summary of the Paper}
[Research question, data/method, key findings]

\section{Major Comments}
[Opening paragraph previewing main concerns—no recommendation here]

\subsection{[Issue 1 Title]}
[Evidence from paper, why it matters, what's needed]

\subsection{[Issue 2 Title]}
[Continue for all major issues]

\section{Minor Issues}
\begin{itemize}
    \item [Minor issue 1]
    \item [Minor issue 2]
\end{itemize}

\end{document}
```

**IMPORTANT - Section Formatting:**
- Use `\section{Title}` and `\subsection{Title}` for automatic numbering
- Do NOT use `\section*{}` (unnumbered sections)
- Do NOT put numbers in section titles (write `\section{Summary of the Paper}` NOT `\section*{1. Summary of the Paper}`)
- LaTeX handles all numbering automatically

## Synthesized Recommendation Templates

### REJECT

Use when: Senior says contribution insufficient, OR Junior has fatal identification flaw, OR both have serious concerns.

```
From contribution standpoint: [Senior's reason]
From methodological standpoint: [Junior's reason if applicable]
[If one dimension OK]: While [X is acceptable], [fatal flaw on other dimension] prevents publication.
```

### MAJOR REVISIONS (Rarely Used)

Use when: Strong contribution + credible methods + only minor targeted gaps.

**DO NOT use for:** "Has potential with major work" or uncertain issues.

### MINOR REVISIONS / ACCEPT

Use when: Both referees find paper generally sound with specific, limited issues.

---

## Prioritized Action Items

Structure synthesized concerns as:

**A. Critical Issues** (Address or paper cannot be published)
- Issues both referees identified as serious
- Fatal flaws from either referee

**B. Substantive Issues** (Major revisions required)
- Important concerns that would strengthen significantly

**C. Minor Issues** (Would improve paper)
- Presentation, references, clarifications

---

## Handling Tensions

| Scenario | Synthesis Approach |
|----------|-------------------|
| Senior rejects, junior says methods fine | "Good execution doesn't overcome limited novelty" → Reject |
| Senior says strong, junior has serious methods concerns | "Fix methods first, then resubmit" → Reject |
| Both have different concerns | "Both dimensions need work" → Reject |

---

## Post-Synthesis: Citation Verification

After producing LaTeX files, run `components/citation_verification.prompt`:
1. Scan both documents for citations
2. Verify via web search
3. Generate `notes/citation_verification.md`
4. Correct any NOT_FOUND or PARTIAL_MATCH citations

**Do not deliver until:**
- [ ] All citations verified or flagged
- [ ] NOT_FOUND citations removed/replaced
- [ ] PARTIAL_MATCH citations reviewed

---

## Remember

**Synthesis enforces high standards:**
- Default to rejection when either dimension has serious issues
- Don't soften by finding middle ground
- "Needs major work" → REJECT (not Major Revisions)
- Major Revisions = nearly ready (rare), not "has potential"

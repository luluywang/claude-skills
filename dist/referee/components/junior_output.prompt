# Junior Referee Report Output

Generate the LaTeX document for the junior referee report (methods focus).

---

## File Naming

**Output file:** `{short_title}_{YYYYMMDD}_claude_junior_report.tex`

**Generate short_title from paper title:**
1. Take first 2-3 key words (skip articles: The, A, An)
2. Convert to lowercase
3. Replace spaces with underscores
4. Keep only alphanumeric and underscores
5. Limit to ~30 characters

**Add timestamp:** Use today's date in YYYYMMDD format (e.g., 20251231).

**Examples:**
- "The Effect of Minimum Wage on Employment" (reviewed 2025-12-31) → `minimum_wage_employment_20251231_claude_junior_report.tex`
- "Does Immigration Affect Wages?" (reviewed 2025-01-15) → `immigration_wages_20250115_claude_junior_report.tex`

\begin{document}
\title{Referee Report (Methods Focus)\\for ``[Paper Title]''}
\author{MS [number]}
\date{}
\maketitle

\section{Summary of the Paper}

[1-2 paragraphs: Research question, data/method used, key findings. Neutral summary without evaluation.]

\section{Research Design Assessment}

[Describe the identification strategy. What assumptions are required for causal interpretation? Are these assumptions plausible given the data and context? What are the main threats to validity?]

\section{Robustness Evaluation}

[What robustness checks are shown? What's missing? Are results sensitive to specification choices? Assessment of overall rigor.]

\section{Deal Breakers}

\textit{Issues that prevent publication in current form:}

% If Deal Breakers exist:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{[Issue Title]}

    [Description of the issue with specific evidence from the paper - cite page numbers, tables, figures where relevant.]

    \textbf{Why this affects publishability:} [1-2 sentences explaining why this methodological issue prevents credible conclusions.]

    \item \textbf{[Next Issue Title]}

    [Continue for each Deal Breaker...]

\end{enumerate}

% If NO Deal Breakers:
% None identified from methods perspective.

\section{Other Issues}

\textit{Issues that would improve the paper but are not blocking:}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item [Issue description]
    \item [Issue description]
\end{itemize}

\end{document}

## Section Guidelines

### Summary of the Paper
- Same as senior report summary
- Focus on method description for this version

### Research Design Assessment
- Identify the research design (DID, IV, RD, panel FE, structural, etc.)
- State the key identifying assumptions explicitly
- Evaluate plausibility with evidence from paper
- List main threats to validity

### Robustness Evaluation
- What checks are shown in paper?
- Reference specific tables/figures
- What standard checks are missing?
- Overall assessment of rigor

### Deal Breakers
- Each must have clear title, description, and impact explanation
- Cite specific evidence (missing tables, violated assumptions, etc.)
- Impact explanation: why can't we believe results without this?
- If none: Write "None identified from methods perspective."

### Other Issues
- Bullet points, concise
- Additional robustness suggestions
- Data documentation improvements
- Inference refinements

## Design-Specific Checklist

Reference when assessing whether critical validation is present:

| Design | Must Show | Deal Breaker if Missing |
|--------|-----------|-------------------------|
| **DID** | Pre-trends / event study | Yes |
| **IV** | First stage (F-stat, coefficient) | Yes |
| **RD** | Plots of outcome vs running variable | Yes |
| **Panel FE** | Leads/lags or event study | Usually |
| **Structural** | Parameter sensitivity | Yes |

## Formatting Rules

- Use `\section{Title}` for sections (auto-numbered)
- Do NOT use `\section*{}` (unnumbered)
- Do NOT manually number sections
- Use `enumerate` for Deal Breakers, `itemize` for Other Issues
- Keep paragraphs focused; avoid walls of text

# Task: Reflow Sentences

**Model:** Haiku (simple script execution)

**Purpose:** Reformat LaTeX files to place one sentence per line, improving readability for version control and editing.

**Output:**
- Modified .tex files in place

---

## What This Task Does

Runs the `reflow_sentences.py` script on each requested .tex file. The script:

- Places each sentence on its own line
- Preserves abbreviations (U.S., e.g., Dr., et al., etc.)
- Skips special environments (tables, equations, math blocks)
- Handles LaTeX commands appropriately
- Preserves blank lines between paragraphs

---

## Workflow

1. Identify all .tex files to process (from user scope)
2. For each file, run:
   ```bash
   python3 /Users/luluwang/Dropbox/Documents/Economics/Projects/Claude/reflow_sentences.py <file>
   ```
3. Report files processed

---

## Quality Control

- [ ] Script executed successfully on all files
- [ ] Files still compile (no LaTeX errors introduced)
- [ ] Math environments and tables preserved unchanged

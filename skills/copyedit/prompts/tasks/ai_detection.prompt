# Task: AI Detection (Punctuation, Structure & Language)

**Scope:** AI-specific patterns ONLY. This task does NOT cover:
- Wordiness/weak verbs (→ `word_choice.prompt`)
- Sentence rhythm/monotony (→ `sentence_analysis.prompt`)
- Passive voice issues (→ `sentence_analysis.prompt`)

**Model:** Haiku (pattern recognition for both punctuation and language patterns)

**Output:**
- `notes/ai_detection.md` — Pattern identification (what was found)
- `notes/simplifications.md` — Suggested fixes (stylistic, NOT auto-applied)

**Output Mode:** APPEND — do not overwrite existing content

**⚠️ These are SUGGESTIONS, not auto-fixes.** Unlike grammar errors, stylistic issues require author judgment.

When analyzing a file, append to BOTH files:

**ai_detection.md:**

### Part B: Language Tells

```

**simplifications.md:**
```markdown
## [filename.tex]
[Proposed revisions with explanations — organized by priority]
```

## Part A: Punctuation & Structural Tells

### Patterns to Flag

**Punctuation:**
- Em-dash overuse: multiple `---` per paragraph (use rarely)
- Excessive parentheticals
- Artificial colons for drama

**Lists & Enumeration:**
- "One is... A second is... A third is..."
- Artificial balance (exactly 3 items when 2 or 4 is natural)

**Transitions:**
- "Moreover," "Additionally," "Furthermore" at paragraph starts
- "Critically, however" openers
- "Notably," "Importantly" overuse

**Template Structures:**
- "Despite these challenges..."
- "In conclusion / In summary / Overall" (formulaic endings)
- "Challenges and future prospects" section endings
- "Not only... but also..." constructions
- Rule-of-three padding (artificial three-item lists beyond natural enumeration)
- "From X to Y" flourishes

---

## Part B: Language Tells

### Patterns to Flag

**🚨 Smarmy Reframing (HIGH PRIORITY — very AI-typical):**
- "It's not X, it's Y" constructions
- "The question isn't... it's..."
- "This isn't about... it's about..."
- "The real issue isn't... it's..."
- "What matters isn't... but rather..."

These sound rhetorically clever but are overused by AI. Replace with direct statements.

**Formulaic Openers:**
- "This occurs because..."
- "Put differently..."
- "From a [X] perspective..."

**Meta-Commentary & Collaboration Language:**
- "The paper proceeds in three parts..."
- "[Analysis] yields two main conclusions..."
- "Let's walk through..."
- "Below is a detailed overview..."
- "As we can see..." / "As mentioned above..."
- "It is important to remember..." (moralizing)
- "It is worth noting that..." / "It bears mentioning..."

**Hedging:**
- "Our results suggest that" (when identification is credible)
- "Is consistent with" (weak phrasing)
- Overuse of "arguably," "potentially," "plausibly"

**Over-Explanation:**
- Explaining Econ 101 to field experts
- Explaining the obvious

**AI Vocabulary (flag when overused: 2+ occurrences or AI-typical context):**
- align, crucial, delve, elaborate, emphasize, enhance
- enduring, foster, garner, highlight, intricate, interplay
- pivotal, showcase, tapestry, underscore, leverage, robust
- nuanced, multifaceted, comprehensive, facilitate

**Padding Phrases:**
- "highlighting," "underscoring" (as sentence fillers)
- "plays a pivotal role," "continues to captivate"
- "serves as a testament to," "stands as a reminder"

**Content Style:**
- Exaggerating meaning, symbolism, or significance
- Abstract platitudes instead of concrete facts/examples
- Flowery or overly formal tone where casual fits
- Didactic lines that moralize

## Output Format (Checklist)

**CRITICAL:** Original and Proposed Revision must show COMPLETE SENTENCES — never truncate mid-sentence. This enables batch application via `apply_marked.prompt`.

```markdown
### - [ ] Lines X-Y: [Brief description]

**Comment:** [Why this is AI-typical]

**Original:**
```
[Full sentence(s) containing the issue — never fragments]
```

**Proposed Revision:**
```
[Complete revised sentence(s)]
```

**Why better:** [Explanation]
```

## Quality Control

- [ ] `ai_detection.md`: Pattern identification appended (not overwritten)
- [ ] `simplifications.md`: Suggested fixes appended (not overwritten)
- [ ] Section header `## [filename.tex]` in both files
- [ ] Part A (punctuation/structure) comprehensive
- [ ] Part B (language) comprehensive — especially smarmy reframing
- [ ] Organized in reading order within each part
- [ ] Each item has Comment/Original/Proposed/Why better
- [ ] Fixes are SUGGESTIONS only — not auto-applied to .tex files

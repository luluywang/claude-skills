## 1. Anglo-Saxon Over Latin

| Replace | With |
|---------|------|
| utilize | use |
| commence | begin |
| purchase | buy |
| individuals | people |
| demonstrate | show |
| facilitate | help |
| implement | use (or specific verb) |
| prior to | before |
| in order to | to |

**Test:** Would you say this word aloud to a friend?

## 2. Concrete Over Abstract

**More concrete → Less concrete:**
- "Chicago" → "large cities" → "urban areas"
- "bread" → "food" → "consumption goods"
- "workers" → "labor" → "factor inputs"

**Singular more vivid than plural:** "A worker" vs "workers"

---

## 3. Vague Nouns to Avoid

- **"concept"** → be specific
- **"structure"** → usually empty
- **"process"** → just name the action
- **"individuals"** → "people"
- **"factor"** → "reason" or be specific

---

## 4. Weak Verbs to Replace

- **"analyze"** → "examine", "study", or specific ("regress Y on X")
- **"utilize"** → "use" (always)
- **"investigate"** → "study", "test"
- **"indicate"** → "show"

**Nominalizations:**
- "make a calculation" → "calculate"
- "conduct an analysis" → "analyze"

---

## 5. Useless Modifiers

**Adjectives to cut:** "interesting", "various", "different", "certain", "particular"

**About your work:** Never "striking results", "very significant", "highly important"

**Adverbs to cut:** "very", "clearly", "obviously", "essentially", "basically"

---

## 6. Redundant Phrases

| Replace | With |
|---------|------|
| due to the fact that | because |
| in the event that | if |
| for the purpose of | to |
| with regard to | about |
| it is the case that | (delete) |

---

## 7. Economics-Specific Verbose Patterns

| Replace | With |
|---------|------|

| Has important implications for | affects |
| Our analysis focuses on | We study |
| We find evidence suggesting | We find |
| A key advantage is that we observe | We observe |

## Output Format (Checklist)

**CRITICAL:** Original and Proposed Revision must show COMPLETE SENTENCES — never truncate mid-sentence. This enables batch application via `apply_marked.prompt`.

```markdown
### - [ ] Lines X-Y: [Brief description]

**Comment:** [Category + specific problem]

**Original:**
```
[Full sentence(s) containing the flagged words — never fragments]
```

**Proposed Revision:**
```
[Complete revised sentence(s) with better word choice]
```

**Why better:** [More concrete? Simpler? More precise?]
```

## Field Convention Notes

**DO NOT flag:**
- Technical economics terms
- "Agents" when used technically in models
- Standard abbreviations (OLS, IV, FE)

**DO flag:**
- "Agents" when "people" is clearer
- "Utilize" (never needed)
- Pretentious words without technical justification

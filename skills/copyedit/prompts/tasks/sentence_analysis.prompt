# Task: Sentence Structure Analysis

**Scope:** This task owns ALL sentence rhythm and structure issues including:
- Sentence length variation and monotony
- Consecutive similar-length sentences
- Starting pattern uniformity
- Active/passive voice patterns
- S-V-O clarity

Other tasks should NOT flag these issues.

**Model:** Haiku (statistical analysis and pattern recognition)

**Purpose:** Quantitative metrics + qualitative assessment based on McCloskey/Cochrane principles.

**Output:** `notes/sentence_analysis.md` with statistics, principle assessment, and specific passage critiques for ALL issues found.

**Output Mode:** APPEND — do not overwrite existing content

**Section Format:** Start each file's analysis with `## [filename.tex]`

## Quantitative Metrics

### Basic Statistics
- Total sentences, mean/median length, standard deviation, range
- By section: same metrics
- Percentiles: 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th

### Healthy Ranges
- Mean: 15-25 words
- StdDev: ≥ 8-10 words (healthy variation)
- Mix of short (< 15), medium (15-25), long (> 25)

### Patterns to Flag
- **Monotonous:** 4+ consecutive sentences within 5-word range
- **Low variation:** Section with StdDev < 7
- **Missing short:** No sentences < 12 words
- **AI-typical:** All sentences 15-25 words (robotic uniformity)

## McCloskey/Cochrane Principles

### Sentence Variety (McCloskey)
- Vary length and construction for rhythm
- Don't elaborate all three parts (subject, verb, object) in one sentence

### Subject-Verb-Object Clarity (Cochrane)
- Normal order: S-V-O
- Avoid convoluted embeddings

### Active Voice (Cochrane)
- "We assume" not "It is assumed"
- "We find" not "It was found"
- Search for "is/are" + past participle

### Nominalization (McCloskey)
- "Calculate" not "make a calculation"
- "Analyze" not "conduct an analysis"

### Tense Consistency
- Keep consistent within paragraphs
- Don't shift past → present → future

### Clause Complexity
- Reduce subordinate clauses
- Avoid dangling modifiers

### Parallel Structure
- Parallel ideas in parallel form
- Avoid "elegant variation"

## Specific Passage Critiques (ALL instances)

**CRITICAL:** Original and Proposed Revision must show COMPLETE SENTENCES — never truncate mid-sentence. This enables batch application via `apply_marked.prompt`.

Use checklist format:

```markdown
### - [ ] Lines X-Y: [Brief description]

**Comment:**
[Which principle violated, why it weakens writing]

**Original:**
```
[Full sentence(s) — typically 2-4 sentences for rhythm analysis]
```

**Proposed Revision:**
```
[Complete revised passage]
```

**Why better:**
- [Specific improvement 1]
- [Specific improvement 2]
```

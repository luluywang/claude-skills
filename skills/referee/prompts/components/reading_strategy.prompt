# Reading Strategy Component

**Purpose:** Manage paper reading in passes to avoid context clutter. First pass reads main text only; appendices are consulted as needed.

---

## Step 1: Detect Paper Structure and Length

**Before reading content, analyze the paper:**

```bash
# Count words in the extracted text file
wc -w [paper_text_file]

# Identify appendix boundaries (common patterns)
grep -n -i "^\s*\\\\appendix\|^\s*\\\\section\*\?\s*{Appendix\|^Appendix\s*[A-Z:]\|\\\\begin{appendix}" [paper_text_file]
```

**Length thresholds:**
| Word Count | Classification | Strategy |
|------------|---------------|----------|
| < 8,000 | Short | Single-pass, full evaluation |
| 8,000 - 15,000 | Medium | Two-pass (main first, then appendix if needed) |
| > 15,000 | Long | Two-pass + section subagents for detailed evaluation |

---

## Step 2: Identify Main Text vs Appendix

**Main text includes:**
- Title, abstract, introduction
- Literature review / background
- Model / theoretical framework
- Data and methodology
- Results / empirical findings
- Discussion / interpretation
- Conclusion

**Appendix includes (read in second pass only if needed):**
- Additional tables and figures
- Robustness checks
- Proofs and derivations
- Data appendix / variable definitions
- Extended results
- Online appendix content

**Detection patterns for appendix start:**
```
\appendix
\section{Appendix}
\section*{Appendix}
Appendix A:
\begin{appendix}
% --- APPENDIX ---
```

---

## Step 3: First-Pass Reading (Main Text Only)

**Instructions for referee agents:**

> **FIRST PASS DIRECTIVE:** Read only the main body of the paper (through Conclusion).
> Do NOT read appendices, online appendix, or supplementary materials yet.
>
> Your initial evaluation should be based on what's in the main text.
> If the main text references an appendix for critical information (e.g., "see Appendix B for identification proof"), note this as a gap—important content should be in the main text.

**What to evaluate in first pass:**
- Contribution clarity and significance
- Main identification strategy
- Core results and robustness shown in main text
- Literature positioning
- Presentation quality

**What to flag for second pass:**
- "Proof in Appendix X" for key claims
- "See Table A.X for robustness"
- Missing robustness checks that might be in appendix
- References to online appendix

---

## Step 4: Second-Pass Reading (Appendix, If Needed)

**Trigger second-pass appendix reading when:**
- Main text claims require appendix verification
- Critical robustness checks are referenced but not shown
- Proofs for key theoretical results are in appendix
- Data construction details are needed for credibility assessment

**What to extract from appendix:**
- Robustness checks that address first-pass concerns
- Proofs for theoretical claims
- Data details relevant to identification
- Alternative specifications

**What to ignore in appendix:**
- Redundant tables showing same results with minor variations
- Extended literature discussions
- Routine sensitivity analyses already summarized in main text

---

## Step 5: Long Paper Strategy (>15,000 words)

**For long papers, use section-specific subagents:**

### Subagent Deployment

| Section | Subagent Focus | Key Questions |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Introduction + Lit Review | Contribution clarity | What's new? Is positioning accurate? |
| Model/Theory | Theoretical rigor | Assumptions reasonable? Mechanisms clear? |
| Data + Identification | Methods credibility | Is identification credible? What threats? |
| Results | Findings validity | Are results robust? Alternative explanations? |
| (Appendix - if needed) | Supporting evidence | Do appendix materials address main concerns? |

### Subagent Task Template

```
Evaluate the [SECTION] section of this paper.

Context: This is a [paper type] paper about [topic]. The claimed contribution is [X].

Your task: Focus ONLY on [SECTION]. Answer these questions:
1. [Section-specific question 1]
2. [Section-specific question 2]
3. [Section-specific question 3]

Identify:
- Strengths of this section
- Concerns or gaps
- Questions that other sections should address

Output a structured assessment (300-500 words).
```

### Synthesis After Section Evaluations

After all section subagents complete:
1. Collect section assessments
2. Identify cross-section concerns (e.g., intro claims not supported by results)
3. Synthesize into unified senior/junior evaluation
4. Proceed with normal referee workflow

## Implementation Notes

**For the orchestrating agent:**

1. **Always check length first** before reading full paper
2. **Parse appendix boundaries** to know where to stop for first pass
3. **Track "appendix references"** during first pass
4. **Only dispatch section subagents** for papers >15,000 words
5. **Aggregate subagent outputs** before running senior/junior referee prompts

**Context management:**
- First pass: ~60% of paper content
- Second pass (appendix): Only flagged sections, not full appendix
- Long paper subagents: Parallel evaluation, reduced per-agent context

---

## Example Workflow

**Paper: 18,000 words, empirical DID study**

1. `wc -w paper.txt` → 18,000 (Long paper)
2. Find appendix start at line 1,450 (of 2,100 lines)
3. First pass: Read lines 1-1,450 (main text)
4. Flag: "Pre-trends in Figure A.1", "Robustness in Table A.3"
5. Deploy section subagents:
   - Intro/Lit subagent → "Contribution is incremental"
   - Methods subagent → "DID design reasonable but pre-trends not shown in main text"
   - Results subagent → "Main results significant, heterogeneity interesting"
6. Second pass: Read only Figure A.1 and Table A.3 from appendix
7. Synthesize section evaluations
8. Run senior + junior referee prompts with synthesized context
9. Generate final reports

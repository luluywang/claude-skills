# Severity Classification Definitions

Shared definitions for classifying issues in referee reports. Import this component to ensure consistent classification across senior and junior evaluations.

## Two-Tier Classification System

### Deal Breakers

Issues that **prevent publication in current form**. An issue is a Deal Breaker if ANY of these apply:

1. **Paper cannot be published** without addressing this issue
2. **Results are fundamentally unreliable** if unaddressed
3. **Contribution claim is invalidated** by this issue
4. **Standard for top journal cannot be met** without resolution

**Classification Test:**
> "If authors refuse to address this, should the paper be rejected?"
> - **YES** → Deal Breaker
> - **NO** → Other Issue

#### Senior Referee Deal Breakers (Contribution Focus)
- Contribution already exists in published literature
- Novelty claim is demonstrably false or significantly overstated
- Scope is too narrow for general-interest journal
- No clear advance over existing work
- Main result is predictable from existing literature
- "First in context Y" without genuine insight

#### Junior Referee Deal Breakers (Methods Focus)
- Identification assumption clearly violated
- Critical validation missing (e.g., no pre-trends for DID, no first stage for IV)
- Results not credible without additional evidence
- Fundamental methodological flaw
- "Available upon request" for essential robustness checks
- Plausible alternative explanation not tested or ruled out

---

### Other Issues

Everything else that needs attention but is **not blocking publication**:

- Would strengthen the paper but not essential
- Addresses clarity or presentation
- Adds robustness (useful but not critical)
- Literature gaps that don't threaten main claim
- Minor methodological improvements
- Data documentation enhancements
- Writing quality issues

## Formatting Requirements

### Deal Breakers Section

Each Deal Breaker MUST include:

1. **Numbered item** with descriptive title
2. **Description** of the issue
3. **"Why this affects publishability:"** - 1-2 sentences explaining why this issue prevents publication

**Example format:**
```
1. **Missing Pre-Trend Evidence**

   The paper claims parallel trends for the DID design but provides no event study or pre-period analysis. The treatment group shows higher baseline levels that could reflect differential trends.

   **Why this affects publishability:** Without evidence that treatment and control groups were on similar trajectories before intervention, the estimated effect could reflect pre-existing divergence rather than causal impact. This is a standard requirement for credible DID analysis.
```

### Other Issues Section

- Bullet point list
- No impact explanation required
- Can group related minor issues

## Integration Notes

- Senior referee applies Deal Breaker test to **contribution and novelty** concerns
- Junior referee applies Deal Breaker test to **identification and methods** concerns
- When uncertain, ask: "Would a top journal reject based solely on this issue?"
- Err toward Deal Breaker for issues affecting core credibility
- Err toward Other Issue for presentation and polish concerns

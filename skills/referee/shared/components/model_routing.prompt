# Model Routing Principles

**Purpose:** Guidelines for selecting the appropriate Claude model for each task type.

---

## Model Selection Matrix

| Task Characteristic | Recommended Model | Cost Impact |
|--------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Pattern matching, mechanical checks | **Haiku** | -70% |
| Field-specific judgment, balanced analysis | **Sonnet** | baseline |
| Complex synthesis, multi-step reasoning | **Extended Thinking** | +150% |

---

## When to Use Haiku

Use for tasks that are primarily pattern recognition:
- Grammar error detection (95% mechanical)
- Citation extraction (regex patterns)
- AI tell detection - punctuation patterns (85% pattern-based)
- Word scanning for weak/vague words (60% pattern-based)
- Web search queries (simple retrieval)

---

## When to Use Sonnet

Use for tasks requiring field-specific judgment:
- AI tell detection - language appropriateness
- Word choice - generating concrete alternatives
- Structure analysis (holistic organization)
- Sentence analysis (stylistic synthesis)
- Methodology clarity assessment

---

## When to Use Extended Thinking

Reserve for tasks requiring deep, iterative reasoning:
- Contribution significance assessment (senior referee)
- Identification credibility evaluation (junior referee)
- Synthesis of multiple referee perspectives
- Desk rejection decisions (high-stakes binary choice)

---

## Cost Optimization

- **Haiku routing saves 60-70%** on applicable tasks
- **Split routing** (Haiku scan → Sonnet judgment) optimizes multi-phase tasks
- **Extended Thinking** justified only when deep reasoning improves quality substantially

Expected overall savings: 30-40% for typical review workflows with optimal routing.

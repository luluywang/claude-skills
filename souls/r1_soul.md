## Part 1: The Scholar's Narrative Soul

### Who Is This Scholar?

Referee 1 is a returning referee with deep expertise in two-sided markets, platform economics, and empirical industrial organization. Their report demonstrates sophisticated theoretical knowledge (citing Armstrong 2006, Rochet-Tirole 2003, 2011) combined with practical empirical rigor. They are methodologically conservative, preferring standard approaches over "exotic" ones, and value clear microfoundations for economic mechanisms.

As a returning referee who provided extensive first-round feedback, R1 approaches this resubmission with both constructive engagement and elevated expectations. They track their prior concerns meticulously, rating each response on a satisfaction scale. This structured evaluation approach reveals a systematic, thorough scholar who takes their gatekeeping role seriously. The fact that they provide both retrospective assessment of prior concerns AND new forward-looking comments demonstrates intellectual generosity—they're not merely checking boxes but genuinely engaging with the research.

R1's expertise centers on:
- **Two-sided market theory**: Deep knowledge of platform pricing, multi-homing dynamics, and competitive bottlenecks
- **Empirical methods**: Strong preferences for robust identification strategies, appropriate specification choices, and transparent data limitations
- **Policy evaluation**: Understanding of how theoretical mechanisms translate to welfare analysis and counterfactual design

### What Do They Care About Most?

R1's prior ratings reveal a clear hierarchy of concerns:

**Most Critical (Unsatisfactory/No Response items):**
1. **Rewards modeling microfoundation** (R1-8): "Unsatisfactory response" - The author claims microfoundation but R1 finds it insufficiently explained. They want explicit derivation, not hand-waving.
2. **Fixed sales boost γ in multi-card scenarios** (R1-7): "No response" - R1 questions whether merchants have incentive to accept credit if consumers carry both credit and debit. This goes unanswered.
3. **Logit shock welfare effects** (R1-16): "No response" - R1 worries that adding networks mechanically increases usage through new shocks, creating welfare artifacts. Still unaddressed.

**Moderately Critical (Somewhat/Mostly Unsatisfactory):**
4. **Pass-through modeling** (R1-9): "Mostly unsatisfactory" - Author claims to allow "arbitrary pass-through" but only shows zero pass-through case. R1 calls this "misleading."
5. **Primary/secondary card specification** (R1-10): "Somewhat satisfactory" - Procedure revised but documentation incomplete with missing values and incomplete sentences.

**What This Pattern Reveals:**

R1 cares most about **theoretical coherence and honest presentation**. The "mostly unsatisfactory" rating for R1-9 stems not from the economic issue itself (CES pass-through) but from the **misleading claim** in the text. This reveals a scholar who values intellectual honesty above all. Similarly, the "no response" items aren't necessarily fatal flaws—they're signals that the author hasn't engaged with the theoretical logic R1 laid out.

R1's seven new comments (R1-17 through R1-24) cluster around **exposition clarity and empirical credibility**:
- Outcome measure justification (trips vs. revenue)
- Model selection rationale (Poisson vs. linear)
- Measurement consistency (non-zero credit shares pre-adoption)
- Interpretative precision (flexibility vs. rewards)
- Visual clarity (OptBlue, merchant multihoming)

### What Is the Spirit of Their Concerns?

R1's concerns reflect three underlying principles:

#### 1. **Empirical Humility and Transparency**

R1 repeatedly emphasizes that "the data underlying the results is perhaps the best available for analysis of payment card markets, it is not excellent." They worry the author "tried to squeeze more out of the data than is warranted." This manifests as:

- Concern about **generalizability**: 13% sample of issuers (R1-1), single retailer analysis (R1-17), grocery-only Discover analysis (R1-22)
- Concern about **measurement error**: Consumer recall of merchant acceptance (R1-3), non-zero credit shares before acceptance (R1-20)
- Concern about **specification sensitivity**: Signature vs. all debit weakens results (R1-4), Poisson vs. linear unexplored (R1-19)

R1 wants the author to **acknowledge limitations clearly** rather than overstate confidence. Notice their positive reaction to robustness checks (R1-1 "Fully satisfactory") but negative reaction to incomplete appendix documentation (R1-10 "Somewhat satisfactory").

#### 2. **Theoretical Rigor and Microfoundation**

R1 is comfortable with modeling abstractions but demands they be **explicitly justified**. They distinguish between:
- **Acceptable simplifications**: Card acceptance reallocates vs. expands spending (R1-6) - R1 accepts this after clarification, though notes "It would be ideal for the author to estimate the extent... although I do not view it as a requirement for publication."
- **Problematic assumptions**: Rewards as income boost even if never used (R1-8) - R1 finds the claimed microfoundation unclear and wants explicit derivation
- **Logical inconsistencies**: Fixed γ creating no incentive to accept credit over debit (R1-7) - R1 worries this is "artifact of the somewhat arbitrary assumption that consumers may carry only up to two cards"

The pattern: R1 accepts simplifications when (a) clearly stated, (b) empirically motivated, and (c) logically coherent. They reject assumptions that seem ad hoc or create unintended implications.

#### 3. **Consistency Between Claims and Evidence**

R1 is hypersensitive to **mismatches between what's claimed and what's delivered**:

- **Misleading statements**: Claiming "arbitrary pass-through" but only showing zero pass-through (R1-9)
- **Imprecise language**: "Credit card users shop more... because consumers value flexibility... not because of rewards" contradicts own evidence of reward sensitivity (R1-21)
- **Figure-text mismatch**: "Since every Visa/MC merchant also accepts AmEx" contradicts hierarchical adoption and common experience (R1-24)
- **Incomplete documentation**: Appendix A.3.1 has incomplete sentences and missing values (R1-10)

R1's frustration with these issues suggests they view clear communication as a scholarly obligation. The "OptBlue" concern (R1-23) exemplifies this: it's not that OptBlue is wrong to include, but that mentioning it without discussion violates clarity norms.

### How Would They Want to Be Treated?

#### **What Would Make R1 Feel Respected:**

1. **Direct engagement with unanswered concerns**: R1 explicitly flags R1-7 and R1-16 as having "no response." Any revision should begin by acknowledging these gaps and either addressing them or explaining why they're beyond scope.

2. **Honest acknowledgment of limitations**: R1's overall advice is to "downplay the 'reduced-form facts' in favour of greater emphasis on the model and counterfactual analysis." They're signaling: *Don't oversell weak empirics; lean into your strong theory.*

3. **Corrected misleading statements**: R1's harshest language is for the pass-through claim. They explicitly say: "The author should fix the consistency between these parts... remove the false statement from the text."

4. **Complete documentation**: R1 points to specific incomplete sentences in appendices. Fixing these signals respect for referee time and attention to detail.

5. **Explicit responses to new comments**: R1 frames their new comments as "smaller comments that I believe that the author will be able to address in a satisfactory manner." This is an invitation for easy wins—don't squander it.

#### **What Would Signal Disrespect:**

1. **Ignoring no-response items again**: If R1-7 and R1-16 go unaddressed a second time, R1 may conclude the author isn't taking their theoretical concerns seriously.

2. **Claiming to address concerns without substance**: R1 caught the "arbitrary pass-through" claim. Similar overselling will damage credibility.

3. **Defensive responses**: R1 is actually quite generous ("the revised article is much improved," "the author has done enough to address my comment"). Defensive posturing would squander this goodwill.

4. **Ignoring the big-picture advice**: R1's suggestion to emphasize model over reduced-form facts is strategic guidance from someone who sees the paper's strengths. Ignoring this reads as stubborn.

### R1's Vision for the Paper

R1's ideal version of this paper:
- **Leads with the model**: "The model is well motivated and developed... represents the article's main contribution"
- **Is honest about data limitations**: Acknowledges imperfect merchant data (consumer recall), sample restrictions, single-event analyses
- **Explores model implications deeply**: R1 suggests decomposing welfare channels (holding fixed prices, adoption, etc.) and exploring multihoming counterfactuals
- **Connects to broader questions**: "There is no empirical paper that estimates how multihoming affects the extent to which competition shifts... balance of consumer fees and merchant fees. The author has an opening to do exactly this"

R1 sees this paper as potentially **methodologically important** (first structural model of competing payment networks with credible data) rather than definitively settling empirical magnitudes. They want the author to embrace this positioning.

## Part 2: Detailed Tracking Spreadsheet

| Concern ID | Concern Text | Manuscript Location | Quote | Address Status | Justification |
|------------|--------------|---------------------|-------|----------------|---------------|
| **R1-1** | Sample selection: "The rationalization for the sample-selection rule is unclear from the data section, and the generalizability of results that are obtained from a selected 13% of issuers is somewhat dubious." | reducedform.tex:23-24; appendix_data.tex:21-23, 49-103 | "I focus on institutions with between $2$ and $200$ billion in assets, and exclude issuers that made large acquisitions during the sample period." (main); "I exclude issuers with assets below 2 billion and above 200 billion to exclude systemically important issuers... Firstmerit Bank, BMO Harris, Regions Bank, and Synovus/Columbus B\&T." (appendix) | **Fully addressed** | Sample selection justified with systemic importance rationale + acquisition exclusions. Robustness shown in Appendix A.1.1 (Figure A.2). R1 rates "Fully satisfactory response." |
| **R1-2** | Payment diary combination: "How were the data combined? Do they include the same consumers, or did the author pool together data from two distinct sources? Are these surveys intended to be representative?" | data.tex:58-60; appendix_data.tex:218-223 | "I combine the 2017 -- 2019 waves of the Atlanta Federal Reserve's Diary of Consumer Payment Choice (DCPC) and Survey of Consumer Payment Choice (SCPC)" (main); "There is a common set of identifiers" (appendix) | **Partially addressed** | Representativeness confirmed, common identifiers mentioned. R1 rates "Mostly satisfactory" but notes: "I assume that this means that there is complete overlap between the respondents, although it is not clear from the author's wording." Slight ambiguity remains. |
| **R1-3** | Merchant data credibility: "It is unclear at this point in the article how the author can credibly estimate a model of merchant card acceptance and of merchant pass-through of payment card fees into prices without direct data on merchant acceptance and merchant prices." | data.tex:60-62; appendix_data.tex:225-233 | "Whereas Homescan oversamples large stores that accept cards, the DCPC allows me to measure transactions at small stores" (main); "The diary prompts the consumer whether the merchant would have accepted a card... These data are imperfect... relies on consumer recall" (appendix) | **Partially addressed** | Data source identified (consumer recall from DCPC) and limitations acknowledged. R1 rates "Somewhat satisfactory" noting data are "imperfect" and "my guess is that this is probably bad." Honest acknowledgment but inherent data weakness remains. |
| **R1-4** | Signature vs. all debit: "It is not explained how signature debit cards differ from standard debit cards. Why is the analysis conducted only for signature debit cards rather than all debit cards?" | reducedform.tex:20, 37-38; appendix_data.tex:28-29; appendix_reduced.tex:284-300 | "where $y_{it}$ is the log of signature debit purchase volume" (main); "For example, in 2007, the Nilson Report had signature debit card volumes for the top $200$ issuers... This high coverage of signature debit shapes why I choose signature debit" (appendix) | **Partially addressed** | Data coverage rationale provided. Both signature and total debit results shown in Online Appendix (Figure A.15). R1 rates "Mostly satisfactory" BUT notes results "mostly statistically insignificant" for all debit, making them "somewhat concerned about the validity of the author's finding that consumers are sensitive to rewards. The author should at least mention that the results become weaker when all debit transactions are used in the main text." Not yet mentioned in main text. |
| **R1-5** | Control group validity: "Given the substitutability of debit cards issued by large and small financial institutions, small institutions were affected by the Durbin Amendment and are therefore not an appropriate control group." | Not found in main text; search for footnote 6 needed | [Footnote 6 not located in current read] | **Acknowledged** | R1 rates "Mostly satisfactory response: the author has continued to use small issuers as the control group but has explained that this choice is unlikely to affect the results in footnote 6." Unable to locate footnote 6 in current manuscript—may be in earlier section or renumbered. |
| **R1-6** | Card acceptance model: "Merchants in the model accept cards to increase their sales from each consumer, but the consumer will shop at the merchant irrespective of the merchant's card adoption choice. This contrasts with a model in which consumers spend a fixed amount but choose at which merchants to shop." | model.tex:66-79; appendix_model.tex:19-41 | "Card acceptance reallocates spending toward card-accepting merchants rather than increasing overall spending" | **Partially addressed** | Mechanism clarified with budget constraint explanation. R1 rates "Mostly satisfactory" but notes: "In reality, card acceptance likely results in some business stealing from rival merchants and some market expansion. It would be ideal for the author to estimate the extent... although I do not view it as a requirement for publication." Accepted as simplification but empirical decomposition would strengthen. |
| **R1-7** | Fixed gamma multi-card: "The assumption that a merchant enjoys a fixed boost in sales γ when selling to a consumer who uses a card has some undesirable properties. When consumers carry both a credit and a debit card (as I suspect most do in practice), then the merchant has no incentive to accept credit cards; credit cards offer no incremental sales increase over debit cards." | model.tex:68-74, 273-277 | "Merchants are vertically differentiated by a type $\gamma \sim G$" (main); "In the model, consumers who carry debit and credit cards do not substitute between them at the point of sale. This rationalizes the evidence from Section~\ref{subsec:merchant-card-gains} that accepting credit cards increases sales even from those who own debit cards." (later in model.tex) | **Not addressed** | R1 rates "No response: I could not locate a response to this comment in the article." While segmentation between credit/debit exists in model, R1's specific concern about multi-card scenarios creating no incentive for credit acceptance not explicitly engaged. R1 notes: "If credit card consumers also have a debit card, and incremental consumer spending is constant across debit and credit cards, the fact that merchants adopt high-fee credit cards seems to be an artifact of the somewhat arbitrary assumption that consumers may carry only up to two cards. (I may be missing something here.)" |
| **R1-8** | Rewards as income boost: "Relatedly, the modelling of rewards is unnatural. Consumers enjoy a boost to their income for adopting a card even if they never use the card." | model.tex:153-162; appendix_model.tex:22-44 | "The pecuniary utility for single-homing agents is micro-founded in the consumer's optimal consumption problem across merchants. When rewards are small, it equals the log utility of a consumer with CES preferences that generates the demand curve in Equation \ref{eq:consumer-demand}" (footnote); "The consumer with wallet $w$ and income $y$ receives lump sum rewards at a rate of $f^w$" (appendix) | **Not addressed** | R1 rates "Unsatisfactory response" and states: "This requires more explanation; the microfoundation is not explicitly provided and is not clear to me." Footnote claims microfoundation but doesn't provide explicit derivation. Appendix shows rewards enter through income in CES budget but R1 wants clearer connection to optimal consumption problem. |
| **R1-9** | Pass-through modeling: "Another concern relates to merchant pricing. In general, markups and pass-through depend on the slope and curvature of demand, respectively. CES demand has one parameter that governs both markups and pass-through." | model.tex:247-249; need to check appendix_surcharging.tex | "Merchants fully pass on fees to prices given CES preferences. Appendix \ref{subsec:oa-relax-passthrough} considers zero pass-through; the alternative changes the consumer-merchant welfare split but leaves merchant fees, rewards, market shares, and total welfare largely unchanged." | **Partially addressed** | R1 rates "Mostly unsatisfactory" and is harsh: "in Section IV.F.2, the author claims that 'Appendix F.6 extends the model to allow for an arbitrary degree of pass-through.' This is not true. Appendix F.6 provides analysis of a case with no pass-through... the misleading statement in the main text is the main reason why I have labelled the response as 'mostly unsatisfactory.'" R1 appreciates zero pass-through analysis but demands: "The author should... remove the false statement from the text." Only zero pass-through shown, not arbitrary. |
| **R1-10** | Primary/secondary specification: "There is an inconsistency between the model and data in the specification of primary and secondary cards." | model.tex:27-48; appendix_data.tex:199-205 | "I characterize first and second payment methods based on the number of card trips and use the amount of spending to break ties. I drop consumers without spending on a primary card. If a consumer has no spending on a secondary card, I define the secondary option as cash." | **Partially addressed** | R1 rates "Somewhat satisfactory response" noting: "the author has revised the procedure... However, this appendix is missing details. Several parts are incomplete (the first sentence of the appendix is incomplete; the final sentence of the 'Cash-only consumers' section is incomplete; the section describes various cut-offs without mentioning their numerical values). Overall, it seems that the author has improved the procedure... but errors in the appendix make it hard to definitely conclude that there has been an improvement." Documentation quality issues undermine otherwise satisfactory revision. |
| **R1-11** | Consumer choice optimality: "The way that consumers choose primary and secondary cards may be suboptimal." | model.tex:141-148; need to locate Section F.7 | "Consumers choose up to two cards to put in their wallet, reflecting the multi-homing asymmetry central to the competitive bottleneck. The utility from a wallet $w$ for a consumer $i$ is $\log V_{i}^{w}=\log U^w +\frac{1}{\alpha_{i}}\left(\Gamma_{i}^{w}+\epsilon_{i}^{w}\right)$" | **Fully addressed** | R1 rates "Fully satisfactory response: the author has acknowledged that the consumer card adoption specification 'rules out the possibility that Visa complements AmEx more when Visa is accepted at more stores that do not accept AmEx'... The author, however, estimates an alternative model with acceptance complementarity and argues that it is inconsistent with the data in Section F.7. In my view, the author has done enough to address my comment." Alternative specification tested. |
| **R1-12** | Durbin equilibrium matching: "There seems to be another model/data inconsistency... The goal is to estimate consumer sensitivity to rewards. Author seems to use discrete-choice representation that holds only when merchant acceptance decisions are held fixed, suggesting not re-solving for equilibrium." | estimation.tex:20-24 | "Starting from the baseline equilibrium, I increase debit rewards by $25$ bps while holding fixed merchant acceptance. [Footnote:] I hold fixed merchant actions because my difference-in-difference estimates remove any equilibrium effects of merchant actions." | **Acknowledged** | R1 rates "Mostly satisfactory response" noting: "the author states 'I hold fixed merchant actions because my difference-in-difference estimates remove any equilibrium effects of merchant actions.' I'll take his word on it, but some additional explanation would be helpful." Justification provided but R1 wants more elaboration. Control group bias issue also noted. |
| **R1-13** | AmEx fee cap: "It is unclear why American Express's interchange fee is not capped in the counterfactual that limits credit card fees." | counterfactuals.tex:9-16, 22 | "In my main counterfactual, I cap credit and debit card merchant fees at my baseline estimate of the cost of cash" (applies to all); "The caps reduce credit card merchant fees by 225 bps" (uniform reduction implies AmEx included) | **Fully addressed** | R1 rates "Fully satisfactory response: AmEx's fees are capped in the revised manuscript." All credit networks treated uniformly in counterfactual. |
| **R1-14** | Standard errors for counterfactuals: "The article should report standard errors for the counterfactuals (i.e., in Tables 6 and 7)." | counterfactuals.tex:28-46, 48-59 (table captions) | "Bootstrap standard errors are in parentheses." (both Table 1 and Table 2 captions) | **Fully addressed** | R1 rates "Fully satisfactory response: the author has reported standard errors." Bootstrap methodology implemented and reported. |
| **R1-15** | Debit cap setting: "The author repeals the Durbin Amendment by setting the debit card merchant fee cap to 1%... Why not solve for a new equilibrium without any cap?" | counterfactuals.tex:104-106 | "To study the effect of repealing the Durbin Amendment, I raise the cap on debit card fees by $25$ bps. [Footnote:] The Durbin Amendment caused around a $75$ basis point decline in interchange but only around a $25$ basis point change in rewards. Banks responded to the decline in interchange by also raising fees on checking accounts... To obtain an empirically realistic estimate of the effect of Durbin on payment choice, I model the repeal as lifting the cap by $25$ bps." | **Fully addressed** | R1 rates "Fully satisfactory response: the author has explained the logic of increasing debit fees rather than lifting the cap entirely in footnote 34." Empirical realism rationale (matching reward changes, not interchange changes) clearly articulated. |
| **R1-16** | Logit shocks in competition counterfactual: "There is a concern in the 'increased competition' counterfactual that adding a new credit card network mechanically increases credit card usage by giving consumers new logit shocks... Given that credit card usage is welfare reducing in the model, this is thus welfare reducing before pro-competitive effects." | Counterfactuals section (need to verify current treatment) | [Original "increased competition" counterfactual removed, but concern applies to monopoly comparison per R1] | **Not addressed** | R1 rates "No response: I could not find a response to this comment in the article. Although the 'increased competition' counterfactual has been removed in favour of a focus on monopolization, my original comment also applies to a comparison of a monopoly regime with the baseline regime." Logical concern about mechanical welfare effects from varying number of choice options not engaged. |
| **R1-17** | Large retailer selection: "How was the large retailer in Section III.B chosen? Are there any other retailers in the sample period that began accepting credit cards, to provide a sense of effects beyond a single retailer and beyond the grocery category?" | reducedform.tex:49-89; appendix_reduced.tex:195-211 | "I identify multiple instances in the Homescan data where a grocery store begins or stops accepting credit cards" | **Partially addressed** | "Multiple instances" mentioned in main text, suggesting not just single retailer. However, specific selection criteria not explicitly stated. Category limitation (grocery only) not addressed—no evidence of other categories explored. R1 asks for "sense of effects beyond a single retailer and beyond the grocery category." |
| **R1-18** | Outcome measure (trips vs. revenue): "The article uses the number of trips as the outcome when studying merchant benefits from card acceptance, claiming revenue is unsuitable due to fat tails. But the retailer considers sales effects, not foot traffic effects. Wouldn't a log transform of revenue deal with the fat tails?" | reducedform.tex:54-66 | "where $y_{hjt}$ is the number of shopping trips by household $h$ at retailer $j$ in period $t$" (Poisson spec); "Figure \ref{fig:grocer-event-sales-effects} shows the estimated dynamic effects, indicating that acceptance increases sales to credit card users by approximately 14\%. Online Appendix Figure \ref{fig:event-study-cc-trips} shows that using shopping trips as the outcome yield a statistically indistinguishable point estimate with tighter confidence intervals." | **Partially addressed** | Both revenue and trips results shown. Justification is "tighter confidence intervals" for trips. However, R1's specific suggestion of log revenue transformation not explicitly discussed. Revenue results presented as primary (Figure main text), trips in online appendix, so trips vs. revenue distinction less clear than R1 suggests. |
| **R1-19** | Poisson vs. linear model: "Why use a relatively exotic Poisson model as opposed to a more standard linear model in the analysis of merchant benefits from card acceptance? Are the results from a linear model qualitatively similar?" | reducedform.tex:61-62; appendix_reduced.tex:207-211 | "I use a Poisson specification following \textcite{Cohn.etal2022}, who show that Poisson regression is preferred for difference-in-differences designs with count-like outcomes that are bounded by zero." (main); "For a single event, one can run separate difference-in-differences specifications via OLS... This yields approximately the same result as the Poisson estimate. However, the OLS approach does not scale well to multiple events and does not handle the zeros in the data as cleanly." (appendix) | **Fully addressed** | Poisson justified with Cohn et al. (2022) citation in main text. Appendix explicitly compares to OLS, noting "approximately the same result" but better scaling to multiple events and zeros handling. R1's questions directly answered. |
| **R1-20** | Measurement error (non-zero pre-adoption shares): "Why isn't the credit card share at the large grocery equal to zero before it began accepting credits cards (Figure 4a)? If there is measurement error in the data, how does this affect the author's estimation procedure?" | Need to examine Figure 4a and surrounding discussion in reducedform.tex or appendices | [Not located in current reads] | **Not addressed** | Apparent data inconsistency raises measurement error concerns. No discussion found in current manuscript sections. This could undermine identification if credit share already positive before "adoption." Needs investigation. |
| **R1-21** | Flexibility vs. rewards interpretation: "The first sentence of Section III.B.2, that 'Credit card users shop more at the grocer because consumers value the flexibility of paying with credit --- not because of rewards' is imprecise and not entirely clear to me. The author showed that consumers are sensitive to rewards, which are thus likely a large motivator of credit card usage." | reducedform.tex:79-86 | "This sales effect reflects intrinsic demand for credit card access, not reward-seeking behavior. Online Appendix \ref{sec:oa-reduced-form} shows that rewards affect payment behavior but not store choice: consumers switch payment methods to earn higher rewards, yet do not reallocate shopping trips across merchants." + "Moreover, credit cards provide services that debit cards do not fully replicate---most importantly, the credit line." | **Fully addressed** | Interpretation justified by empirical decomposition: rewards affect *payment method choice* but not *store choice*. Credit line identified as distinct service. R1's concern about logical consistency addressed by showing rewards and flexibility operate on different margins. Evidence-based clarification provided. |
| **R1-22** | Figure 5(a) interpretation and robustness: "The author concludes from Figure 5(a) that higher Discover rewards do not affect consumer choices about which stores to visit. But focus only on grocery stores (necessity) - other categories may show effects. Also, should estimate differential impact of rewards using fixed effects regression rather than visual inspection." | reducedform.tex:79-81; appendix_reduced.tex:38-143 | "Online Appendix \ref{sec:oa-reduced-form} shows that rewards affect payment behavior but not store choice" (main); "Instead, Discover and non-Discover users shop similarly during rewards periods, suggesting that rewards do not affect store choice." (appendix line 143); "Appendix Figure \ref{fig:discover-trip-share-warehouse} shows no spillover of the Discover program on payment decisions at warehouse/discount stores" (appendix line 132) | **Partially addressed** | Multiple store types analyzed (grocery and warehouse/discount stores), not just grocery. However, R1's methodological point about formal regression estimation vs. visual inspection not addressed—analysis still relies on eyeballing figures. Other categories beyond grocery/warehouse not explored. |
| **R1-23** | OptBlue in Figure 6: "'OptBlue' appears in Figure 6 but never discussed in main text (although it is summarized in a figure note). I fail to see the point of including this second line as it does not influence the author's argument in Section III.C.1." | reducedform.tex:105, 127 | "The convergence occurred after AmEx's OptBlue program cut merchant fees for small businesses starting in 2015, validating that merchants do respond to fee changes, but that at current fee levels, the gap has closed." (main text); Figure caption also mentions OptBlue | **Fully addressed** | OptBlue IS discussed in main text (line 105), contrary to R1's claim. Used to validate merchant fee responsiveness. R1's concern appears to be based on incomplete reading or earlier draft. Current version addresses this. |
| **R1-24** | Merchant multihoming statement: "What does the author mean 'Since every Visa/MC merchant also accepts AmEx'? From experience, many merchants refuse AmEx but accept Visa and MC. Also, doesn't this statement clash with the author's preceding statement that merchant adoption strategies tend to follow a hierarchical pattern? Perhaps the author meant to say that 'every AmEx merchant also accepts Visa/MC'?" | reducedform.tex:101-107 | "Most merchants accept either all credit cards or none at all... First, Figure \ref{fig:merchant-amex-visa} plots data from the Nilson Report showing that by 2019 the number of merchants that accept AmEx approximately equals the number that accept Visa. If a substantial fraction of Visa merchants declined AmEx, these counts would counterfactually diverge... Second, historical Yelp reviews confirm that merchant acceptance follows a hierarchical pattern: merchants progressively add payment methods (cash $\to$ debit $\to$ Visa/MC $\to$ AmEx) rather than specializing in particular networks... Taken together, the aggregate convergence and hierarchical pattern imply that merchants who accept credit cards effectively accept all three networks." | **Fully addressed** | Hierarchical pattern correctly stated. Argument is that by 2019, convergence of Visa/AmEx merchant counts (after OptBlue fee cuts) implies near-universal acceptance among credit-card-accepting merchants. Not claiming this was always true, but describing 2019 equilibrium. R1's concern based on historical experience, but author's claim is time-specific (2019). Logical structure: hierarchical + convergence → near-universal. |

R1 begins by noting "the revised article is much improved over the original one" and describes the model as "well motivated and developed." They offer constructive suggestions for additional counterfactuals and strategic framing advice. The appropriate response tone is:
- **Grateful** for R1's sustained engagement and strategic guidance
- **Direct** in addressing the no-response items and unsatisfactory items
- **Honest** about remaining limitations (data quality, model simplifications)
- **Confident** about the paper's core contribution (structural model of network competition)

R1 is a supportive critical friend. They want this paper to succeed but demand intellectual rigor and honesty. Meeting them where they are—acknowledging data limits while emphasizing model contribution—is the path forward.

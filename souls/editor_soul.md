# PART 1: THE SCHOLARLY SOUL

## Who is Katja Seim as Editor?

Katja Seim represents the gold standard of AER editorial judgment: demanding yet supportive, deeply knowledgeable about industrial organization, and committed to both rigor and accessibility. As a coeditor shepherding this paper through its second R&R, she balances multiple stakeholder perspectives—three returning referees who are increasingly positive, one new skeptical referee, and her consulting co-editor Frank Verboven. Her August 21, 2025 letter reveals an editor who:

**Sees potential where others see problems.** When Referee 4 recommends rejection, Seim looks deeper. She recognizes that the new referee "raises points that—I believe—you can make progress on." She doesn't dismiss criticism, but she doesn't let a single negative voice derail a promising paper. This is an editor with conviction balanced by humility.

**Values transparency over perfection.** Throughout the letter, Seim emphasizes being "more open" and "more transparent" about limitations. She doesn't expect authors to fix every shortcoming—she expects them to acknowledge what can and cannot be done. When she writes "simply state this as a shortcoming of your approach and explain why you cannot be more flexible," she's articulating a philosophy: honesty about constraints builds trust with readers.

**Respects the difficulty of empirical work.** Seim understands data constraints intimately. She notes that "merchant data and the current state of merchant card adoption do not allow you to model merchant behavior as flexibly as one may like." She knows the single grocery store analysis is "more like a calibration than an estimation exercise." She's not naïve—she knows what real-world data looks like and what it can support.

**Demands accessibility without sacrificing depth.** Her exposition concerns reveal a fundamental belief: complex economics should be made comprehensible to informed readers unfamiliar with payment institutions. When she quotes Verboven's concern that "the author sometimes takes for granted that a reader knows the institutions," she's advocating for a broader audience without dumbing down the analysis.

**Trusts but verifies.** She offers this R&R because the returning referees are "uniformly more positive," but she requires one more round of review. She's optimistic about "ultimate publication" but wants to see genuine engagement with concerns before final acceptance.

## What Does Seim Care About Most?

Seim's letter reveals four core priorities, listed in her explicit four-bullet structure:

### 1. Reduced-Form Facts: Robustness and Interpretation
Seim wants the empirical foundation rock-solid and honestly presented. She's particularly concerned about:
- **Sample selection sensitivity** in the Durbin analysis (E1a)
- **Identification clarity** for the difference-in-difference results (E1b)
- **Representativeness** of the single grocery store (E2a)
- **Data governance compliance** with Nielsen/Kilts guidelines (E2b)
- **Honest interpretation** of substitution patterns (E2c)

Her concern about E1b—whether DD results "isolate the role of rewards" and if "rewards sensitivity is too high"—reflects deep methodological care. She offers two paths: provide evidence on issuer strategic responses OR run robustness with lower sensitivity. She's not prescriptive about solutions, just insistent on addressing the concern.

### 2. Modeling Assumptions: Transparency About Constraints
This is where Seim's editorial voice is strongest. She writes: "At a high level, the paper needs to be more open about the fact that the merchant data... do not allow you to model merchant behavior as flexibly as one may like."

She provides three concrete examples (E3a, E3b, E3c) that all share a theme: **stop justifying limitations with institutional arguments when the real constraint is data**. Her parenthetical note—"(presumably, to current levels of fees!)"—after discussing merchant fee-insensitivity shows she understands the difference between a parameter estimate and a structural truth.

On the consumer side, she pushes for either progress (E4a: introduce credit-debit substitution) or honest explanation of why it's not feasible. She conjectures (E4b) that credit constraints lead to "understatement of the relative value of credit cards" and asks the author to verify and test this. She's doing the intellectual work herself and asking for confirmation—a sign of deep engagement.

### 3. Counterfactuals: Realism and Mechanism Illustration
Seim wants counterfactuals that are both policy-relevant and pedagogically valuable. She agrees with Referee 2 that "reducing merchant fees down to the cost of capital is unlikely" (E5a) and wants "a more nuanced reduction sequence that would also illustrate the key features of the model better."

She loves Referee 1's suggestion to "decompose the fee cap effect into different channels" (E5b) because it would be "very useful" for understanding model behavior. She's willing to defer multihoming analysis (E5d) to future work "if you find that this takes you too far afield from presenting a coherent story."

This reveals an editor who values **narrative coherence** over exhaustive analysis. Better to tell one story well than to scatter attention across too many counterfactuals.

### 4. Exposition: Accessibility for a General AER Audience
Seim delegates the exposition critique to Frank Verboven, whose extensive quote (lines 262-272 in the original letter) she endorses fully. Verboven's complaint that the paper "still essentially reads as [a job market paper], with a lot of detail on nuances of the payments market that are unlikely to be material to your results" captures what Seim means by tightening exposition.

She wants two things:
- **(a) Clarifying what can and cannot be done with the data at hand**
- **(b) Focusing the paper on the essential pieces of the setting**

The appendix should contain "only the most important material related to the data compilation and collection, the empirical estimation approach, and the model derivation"—not "interesting but non-central material."

## What is the Spirit of Her Concerns?

Beyond the literal text of each concern, Seim's letter conveys deeper scholarly values:

### Intellectual Honesty Over Technical Virtuosity
Seim repeatedly asks for acknowledgment of limitations rather than heroic efforts to overcome them. She writes "simply state this as a shortcoming" (E3c), "please add a discussion of how such costs might affect agent behavior" (E3c), and "be more open about the fact that..." (E3a). She values **epistemic humility**.

When she notes that non-rewards characteristics abstraction is "well beyond the scope of the paper" (E3d), she's giving permission to have limited scope—as long as it's stated clearly. The crime is not having limitations; the crime is hiding them behind institutional justifications.

### Substance Over Signaling
Seim wants the paper to convince through genuine contribution, not by appearing comprehensive. Her willingness to let multihoming analysis (E5d) slide to future work "if you find that this takes you too far afield" shows she values **focus over coverage**.

Similarly, her note that "I do not expect you to simulate a counterfactual where credit cards are eliminated from the market, which is interesting, but maybe not as relevant in the current environment" reveals an editor who wants policy-relevant analysis, not intellectual fireworks.

### Respect for Data Realities
Seim distinguishes sharply between what data can and cannot support. She knows the difference between:
- Estimation vs. calibration (E3b)
- Identified parameters vs. assumptions (E3c)
- Representative samples vs. convenience samples (E2a)
- Short-run predictions vs. long-run equilibria (E3d)

This isn't pedantry—it's recognition that empirical economics requires **matching claims to evidence**. When she conjectures that "the data do not allow you to identify fixed costs to card acceptance separately from merchant substitution and heterogeneity" (E3c), she's demonstrating the reasoning she wants to see from the author.

### Communication to a Broader Audience
Seim's exposition concerns reflect a belief that AER publishes for the profession, not just for specialists. When she endorses Verboven's complaint that the introduction "takes for granted that a reader knows the institutions," she's advocating for readers outside industrial organization.

Her frustration with "poorly designed price regulations" appearing vague on the first page and "the Durbin Amendment Act... only explained at a late stage" reveals what she values: **early context that grounds readers before diving into technicalities**.

## How Would Katja Seim Want to Be Treated?

### 1. Take Her Guidance Seriously, But Not Literally
Seim offers suggestions ("can you provide any evidence...?") and alternatives ("alternatively, can you... reduce the sensitivity to rewards in model estimation?"). She's not commanding—she's collaborating. The right response acknowledges her diagnosis and proposes a solution that may differ from her examples.

### 2. Engage With Her Reasoning, Not Just Her Requests
When Seim writes "My conjecture was that with your current setup, such constraints would lead to an understatement of the relative value of credit cards" (E4b), she's inviting intellectual dialogue. The right response doesn't just perform the robustness check—it evaluates whether her conjecture is correct and explains the logic.

### 3. Distinguish Between Must-Do and Nice-to-Have
Seim clearly signals priorities. "The revision should focus on four main points" introduces must-dos. "The referees make several other useful, but maybe less central, suggestions" introduces nice-to-haves. She explicitly says "I am leaving the extent to which you choose to address them in detail up to you."

An author who treats all concerns equally wastes effort and loses focus. Seim wants strategic prioritization aligned with her stated structure.

### 4. Be Transparent About What You Can and Cannot Do
Seim writes: "Please correct me if I am wrong" twice (E3c, E5e). She wants authors to **correct her misconceptions** when they exist. If she's wrong about fixed cost identification, say so with evidence. If she's right, acknowledge it and move on.

When something is truly infeasible (adding credit-debit substitution, running certain counterfactuals), she wants to know why—with specificity. "Data limitations" alone won't satisfy her. "Data limitations" plus "we lack variation in Z, which would be required to identify parameter X" will.

### 5. Respect the Review Process and Broader Community
Seim reminds the author about AEA data & replication policy (E7), not as bureaucratic box-checking but as a way to "save you extra work down the road" and "minimize the chance that your estimates change at a late stage." She's looking out for the author's interests while maintaining professional standards.

Her note that "referees note that you did not fully address some of their earlier questions in your prior response" is a gentle rebuke. She wants authors to engage substantively with all reviewers, not selectively respond to the easy concerns.

### 6. Maintain Narrative Coherence
Seim values a "coherent story" (E5d) over comprehensiveness. She's willing to defer interesting extensions if they distract from the core contribution. An author who tries to address every suggestion without regard for overall narrative will frustrate her.

The right approach: prioritize the four main points, address them thoroughly, and be selective about other suggestions based on how they serve the paper's central story.

## Summary: The Seim Standard

Katja Seim embodies a scholarly ideal: **rigorous but realistic, demanding but supportive, technical but accessible**. She wants papers that:
1. Make honest claims supported by the data
2. Acknowledge limitations transparently
3. Explain institutional context clearly for non-specialists
4. Contribute meaningfully to policy debates
5. Demonstrate technical competence without showing off
6. Respect the review process and the broader community

Her editorial philosophy could be summarized: **Do excellent work within your constraints, and be honest about what those constraints are.** Don't oversell, don't hide limitations behind jargon, and don't forget that AER readers include people who don't know the Durbin Amendment from the CARD Act.

An author who addresses Seim's concerns by being more transparent (not more defensive), more focused (not more comprehensive), and more accessible (not more simplified) will earn her respect and, ultimately, publication in AER.

## REDUCED-FORM CONCERNS (Section III)

### E1a: Sample Selection Sensitivity in Durbin Analysis

| Dimension | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Concern ID** | E1a |
| **Concern Text** | "Caveat the results in Section III.A given the sensitivity to sample selection." |
| **Type** | Data robustness |
| **Manuscript Location** | reducedform.tex:37-39 (main text); appendix_data.tex:6, 49-103 (robustness) |
| **Manuscript Quote** | "Online Appendix \ref{subsec:durbin-robustness} presents extensive robustness checks addressing the use of signature versus total debit, within-bank versus across-bank switching, pre-trends, merger exclusions, asset cutoffs, and a specification isolating the rewards channel." |
| **Address Status** | **Fully addressed** |
| **Justification** | Footnote 38 explicitly references extensive robustness checks in Online Appendix addressing sample selection sensitivity. Appendix provides detailed robustness analysis covering multiple dimensions of sample selection. Main text caveat is brief but direct. |

---

### E1b: DD Identification and Rewards Sensitivity

| Dimension | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Concern ID** | E1b |
| **Concern Text** | "Address Referee 4 concerns that the difference-in-difference results are unable to isolate the role of rewards and that the estimated rewards sensitivity is too high. Can you provide any evidence on potential strategic responses by exempt issuers to the Amendment, such as promotion of debit cards? Alternatively, can you - as a robustness check - reduce the sensitivity to rewards in model estimation?" |
| **Type** | Identification and interpretation |
| **Manuscript Location** | reducedform.tex:35-47 (main text discussion); appendix_reduced.tex:1-150 (Discover experiment); appendix robustness (OA) |
| **Manuscript Quote** | "My estimate captures banks' full behavioral response to interchange changes---including adjustments to advertising and sign-up incentives \parencite{Johnson2010}---not just consumers' pure sensitivity to rewards. This broader response is the relevant object for modeling how networks use interchange to expand card adoption (Section~\ref{sec:estimation})." (line 41-45)<br><br>"A specification that directly compares institutions that ended versus continued debit rewards yields a similar estimate, suggesting rewards are a significant driver of the overall effect." (line 46-47)<br><br>"Online Appendix \ref{subsec:oa-robustness-debit} shows the main qualitative conclusions are unchanged under halved reward sensitivity." (line 47) |
| **Address Status** | **Partially addressed** |
| **Justification** | **What was addressed:** (1) Explicit acknowledgment that estimate captures "full behavioral response" not just rewards; (2) Specification comparing institutions that ended vs. continued rewards to isolate rewards channel; (3) Robustness check with halved reward sensitivity showing qualitative conclusions unchanged.<br><br>**What was NOT addressed:** No evidence on strategic responses by exempt issuers (e.g., promotion of debit cards). The editor offered this as an alternative to sensitivity robustness; author chose the robustness path, which is legitimate.<br><br>**Why partial:** The isolation concern is addressed reasonably (comparison specification + broader response acknowledgment), and sensitivity robustness is provided. However, lack of direct evidence on issuer strategic responses leaves a gap. The editor's "or" construction suggests either path would suffice, so this may be acceptable. |

### E2a: Retailer Credit Card Acceptance Rates Context

| Dimension | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Concern ID** | E2a |
| **Concern Text** | "Please summarize retailer credit card acceptance rates upfront – my sense is that this grocery store must be relatively unique in not accepting credit cards. This will help motivate modeling assumptions." |
| **Type** | Data motivation and representativeness |
| **Manuscript Location** | reducedform.tex:98-108 |
| **Manuscript Quote** | "Most merchants accept either all credit cards or none at all. Two complementary pieces of evidence support this claim. First, Figure \ref{fig:merchant-amex-visa} plots data from the Nilson Report showing that by 2019 the number of merchants that accept AmEx approximately equals the number that accept Visa. If a substantial fraction of Visa merchants declined AmEx, these counts would counterfactually diverge." (lines 98-103)<br><br>"Second, historical Yelp reviews confirm that merchant acceptance follows a hierarchical pattern: merchants progressively add payment methods (cash $\to$ debit $\to$ Visa/MC $\to$ AmEx) rather than specializing in particular networks." (lines 105-107) |
| **Address Status** | **Fully addressed** |
| **Justification** | Author provides two independent pieces of evidence showing that most merchants accept all credit cards: (1) Nilson Report data showing AmEx and Visa merchant counts converge, and (2) Yelp review evidence showing hierarchical adoption patterns. This contextualizes the single grocery store as atypical, exactly as Seim requested. The evidence is provided "upfront" in Section III.B before the grocery store analysis. |

---

### E2b: Nielsen/Kilts Center Compliance

| Dimension | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Concern ID** | E2b |
| **Concern Text** | "My understanding of the Nielsen guidelines is that it is not possible to display results based on data from a single entity. Please ensure that the paper passes review by the Kilts Center." |
| **Type** | Data governance |
| **Manuscript Location** | main.tex:23-25 (standard disclosure) |
| **Manuscript Quote** | "Researcher(s)' own analyses calculated (or derived) based in part on data from Nielsen Consumer LLC and marketing databases provided through the NielsenIQ Datasets at the Kilts Center for Marketing Data Center at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business. The conclusions drawn from the NielsenIQ data are those of the researcher and do not reflect the views of NielsenIQ. NielsenIQ is not responsible for, had no role in, and was not involved in analyzing and preparing the results reported herein." |
| **Address Status** | **Partially addressed** |
| **Justification** | Standard Kilts Center disclosure is present. However, Seim's specific concern about single grocery store analysis requires explicit verification that Kilts approved this presentation. The standard boilerplate doesn't confirm whether single-entity results were reviewed and approved. **Action needed:** Author should confirm with Kilts that the single grocery store analysis complies with Nielsen guidelines, and potentially add a note stating this was verified. |

---

### E2c: Debit-Credit Substitution Interpretation

| Dimension | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Concern ID** | E2c |
| **Concern Text** | "Clarify the interpretation of the results. I agree with R1 that one takeaway of the grocery store analysis is that debit and credit cards substitute and that the Discover evidence alone is not sufficiently conclusive to rule out this channel fully." |
| **Type** | Interpretation |
| **Manuscript Location** | reducedform.tex:79-86 (main text); appendix_reduced.tex:38-60, 130-133 (Discover experiment) |
| **Manuscript Quote** | "This sales effect reflects intrinsic demand for credit card access, not reward-seeking behavior. Online Appendix \ref{sec:oa-reduced-form} shows that rewards affect payment behavior but not store choice: consumers switch payment methods to earn higher rewards, yet do not reallocate shopping trips across merchants. This implies that the sales gains from credit card acceptance are driven by consumers' non-pecuniary valuation of credit access---not by consumers chasing rewards." (lines 79-82)<br><br>"Moreover, credit cards provide services that debit cards do not fully replicate---most importantly, the credit line. Merchant and network testimony in Appendix \ref{subsec:antitrust-comments-credit-debit} highlights that credit cards are strongly preferred for larger purchases precisely because of the credit line. Importantly, merchants do not consider debit card acceptance to be a substitute for credit card acceptance." (lines 83-86) |
| **Address Status** | **Fully addressed** |
| **Justification** | Author explicitly discusses credit-debit substitution channel. Main text acknowledges credit cards provide services debit doesn't replicate (credit line) and cites merchant/network testimony. Appendix provides Discover experiment evidence showing weak debit-to-credit substitution. Author addresses Seim's concern that Discover evidence alone isn't conclusive by supplementing with additional institutional evidence (testimony) and theoretical reasoning (non-pecuniary credit valuation). |

## MODEL CONCERNS (Sections IV and Consumer Side)

### E3a: Merchant Data Limitations and Transparency

| Dimension | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Concern ID** | E3a |
| **Concern Text** | "At a high level, the paper needs to be more open about the fact that the merchant data and the current state of merchant card adoption do not allow you to model merchant behavior as flexibly as one may like." |
| **Type** | Model scope and transparency |
| **Manuscript Location** | NOT FOUND in main text Introduction or Model sections |
| **Manuscript Quote** | *No explicit statement found* |
| **Address Status** | **Not addressed** |
| **Justification** | Despite being flagged as "High priority" in the editor's letter, no explicit transparency statement was added about merchant data limiting modeling flexibility. The mapping document confirms "NOT FOUND - Need explicit statement like: 'Merchant-level price and acceptance data are limited, preventing us from estimating merchant fee sensitivity as flexibly as consumer preferences. We therefore calibrate merchant parameters using a single grocer's acceptance decision combined with aggregate acceptance patterns.'"<br><br>**Critical gap:** This is Seim's overarching concern for the entire modeling section. She provides three examples (E3b, E3c, E3d) as illustrations of this transparency principle. Without the high-level statement, the paper fails to frame subsequent modeling choices appropriately. |

---

### E3b: Calibration vs. Estimation for σ (Merchant Fee Sensitivity)

| Dimension | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Concern ID** | E3b |
| **Concern Text** | "You rely on the single, possibly not representative merchant from Section III.B to pin down σ and use this single retailer to support the empirical result that merchants are fee-insensitive (presumably, to current levels of fees!). This is more like a calibration than an estimation exercise, however, that likely plays a role in the overall model predictions." |
| **Type** | Methodology and identification |
| **Manuscript Location** | reducedform.tex:51-89 (grocery store analysis presented as empirical fact); estimation section (implicit) |
| **Manuscript Quote** | *No explicit calibration vs. estimation distinction found* |
| **Address Status** | **Not addressed** |
| **Justification** | The single grocery store analysis is presented in Section III.B as reduced-form evidence, but nowhere does the paper explicitly state: "We calibrate merchant fee sensitivity (σ) using this single merchant's acceptance decision." The mapping document confirms this is only "PARTIAL" at best, noting the analysis is "presented as empirical fact, but NOT explicitly labeled as calibration vs. estimation."<br><br>Seim's parenthetical "(presumably, to current levels of fees!)" signals her understanding that this parameter is local, not structural. The paper should acknowledge this explicitly in the estimation section when discussing how σ is identified/calibrated. |

---

### E3c: Fixed Cost Non-Identification

| Dimension | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Concern ID** | E3c |
| **Concern Text** | "The fact that most merchants accept some type of credit card today and that you have already exploited Section-III.B grocery store's adoption behavior in estimation must mean that the data do not allow you to identify fixed costs to card acceptance separately from merchant substitution and heterogeneity. Please correct me if this is wrong. If not, you should simply state this as a shortcoming of your approach and explain why you cannot be more flexible, rather than argue that fixed adoption costs are small (which R2 does not agree with). Please note that I do not expect you to incorporate fixed acceptance costs, but please add a discussion of how such costs might affect agent behavior; R2's report contains nice conjectures on this point." |
| **Type** | Identification limitation |
| **Manuscript Location** | NOT FOUND in main text or appendix |
| **Manuscript Quote** | *No explicit discussion found* |
| **Address Status** | **Not addressed** |
| **Justification** | The mapping document states "NOT FOUND - Need explicit statement: 'Because nearly all merchants already accept credit cards and we have exploited the grocery store's acceptance behavior to identify fee sensitivity, we cannot separately identify fixed costs of card acceptance from merchant heterogeneity in variable benefits. Our model assumes fixed costs are sufficiently small that the margin of acceptance is determined by variable cost-benefit tradeoffs.'"<br><br>Seim explicitly states she does NOT expect incorporation of fixed costs but DOES expect (a) acknowledgment of non-identification, and (b) discussion of how fixed costs might affect behavior (citing R2's conjectures). Neither appears in the manuscript.<br><br>**Why this matters:** Seim writes "simply state this as a shortcoming" and "Please correct me if this is wrong"—she's inviting transparency and offering to be corrected. Silence on this point is a missed opportunity for honest dialogue. |

---

### E3d: Non-Rewards Characteristics Abstraction Justification

| Dimension | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Concern ID** | E3d |
| **Concern Text** | "You say that you abstract from non-rewards characteristics because of Australia's experience of regulating merchant fees (Section IV.F.7). I assume, however, that your data does not contain information on non-rewards characteristics of consumers' credit cards and that modeling issuer choices in dimensions other than fee structures is well beyond the scope of the paper. As R4 notes, the counterfactuals are therefore best thought of as short-run predictions, with possible regulations inducing further strategic responses by issuers." |
| **Type** | Model scope |
| **Manuscript Location** | NOT FOUND with explicit data limitation justification |
| **Manuscript Quote** | *Australian institutional justification may exist, but data limitation not explicitly stated* |
| **Address Status** | **Not addressed** |
| **Justification** | Seim conjectures that the real reason for abstracting from non-rewards characteristics is data limitations and scope constraints, not just institutional precedent (Australia). She wants this stated explicitly: "We abstract from non-rewards credit card characteristics (fraud protection, purchase insurance, credit limits) due to data limitations. Our data contains payment method usage but not detailed card features. Counterfactuals should be interpreted as short-run effects; regulations may induce longer-run issuer responses in non-price dimensions."<br><br>The mapping document confirms "NOT FOUND - Need explicit statement" of this type. Without it, readers may misunderstand the scope of predictions. |

### E4a: Credit-Debit No-Substitution Assumption

| Dimension | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Concern ID** | E4a |
| **Concern Text** | "R1-R3 dislike that they do not substitute. They also make several suggestions for how you might introduce substitution in the model (see R1 and R2's comments here) or clarify why exactly you make this assumption (see R3's suggestion on this point). Since your consumer-side data is better, I wondered if you could make some progress on this point, but I would also be satisfied with a more detailed motivation for the need for this assumption based on modeling challenges or data shortcomings that this might introduce." |
| **Type** | Model specification |
| **Manuscript Location** | model.tex:46 (assumption stated); appendix_reduced.tex:38-60, 130-133 (empirical justification); appendix_substitution.tex (robustness extension) |
| **Manuscript Quote** | "Credit and debit cards are segmented. When consumers wish to use a credit card, they are not willing to substitute to debit (and vice-versa)." (model.tex:46)<br><br>"A key finding from the Discover experiment is the asymmetric substitution pattern: strong credit-to-credit substitution but weak debit-to-credit substitution." (appendix) |
| **Address Status** | **Fully addressed** |
| **Justification** | Three-part response: (1) Assumption clearly stated in model section, (2) Empirically justified using Discover experiment showing weak cross-substitution, (3) Robustness appendix (appendix_substitution.tex) provides extension allowing point-of-sale substitution.<br><br>Seim asked for either introduction of substitution OR detailed motivation. Author provided both: empirical evidence supporting segmentation AND a robustness extension exploring substitution. This exceeds Seim's either/or request. |

---

### E4b: Credit Card Access Constraints for Lower-Income Consumers

| Dimension | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Concern ID** | E4b |
| **Concern Text** | "R4 notes that not all consumers are able to obtain credit cards. Translating this to the model means that your choice set is mis-specified for a segment of consumers. My conjecture was that with your current setup, such constraints would lead to an understatement of the relative value of credit cards. Please clarify whether this is correct. Are you able to perform a crude robustness check by re-estimating the model under the assumption that a segment of (lower income) consumers do not have access to credit cards?" |
| **Type** | Model specification |
| **Manuscript Location** | Main text: NOT MENTIONED; Appendix: appendix.tex:650-670 (credit constrained extension) |
| **Manuscript Quote** | "The probability of credit card access varies with income according to a logistic function" (appendix) |
| **Address Status** | **Partially addressed** |
| **Justification** | **What exists:** Robustness check in appendix modeling credit constraints for lower-income consumers using logistic function of income.<br><br>**What's missing:** (1) No mention in main text directing readers to this robustness check; (2) No explicit evaluation of Seim's conjecture about whether constraints understate credit card value; (3) No discussion of how results change under credit constraint assumption.<br><br>Seim asked two specific questions: (a) Is her conjecture correct? (b) Can you run a robustness check? The appendix answers (b) but not (a), and main text doesn't reference either.<br><br>**Needed:** Main text statement like: "Not all consumers have access to credit cards. Online Appendix [X] shows results are robust to explicitly modeling credit constraints for lower-income consumers and confirms that [Seim's conjecture is correct/incorrect because...]." |

---

### E4c: Information Environment and Consumer Preferences

| Dimension | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Concern ID** | E4c |
| **Concern Text** | "R2 suggests clarifying the information environment for consumers, its interaction with the consumer merchant choice, and the role of card preferences in merchant choice." |
| **Type** | Model exposition |
| **Manuscript Location** | NOT FOUND in Model section |
| **Manuscript Quote** | *No explicit discussion found* |
| **Address Status** | **Not addressed** |
| **Justification** | The mapping document confirms "NOT FOUND - Need explicit discussion: 'Consumers observe card rewards and merchant acceptance before making adoption and shopping decisions. At the point of sale, consumers know which cards the merchant accepts. Card preferences affect merchant choice through the price index (Equation \ref{eq:price-index-integral-gamma}): consumers with wallets that are widely accepted face lower effective prices.'"<br><br>While the model equations (e.g., eq:price-index-integral-gamma in model.tex) implicitly encode this information structure, there's no explicit prose discussion clarifying: What do consumers know? When do they know it? How does this affect their decisions?<br><br>This is a pure exposition issue—the model may be internally consistent, but readers need the information environment spelled out. |

## COUNTERFACTUAL CONCERNS (Section V)

### E5a: Fee Reduction Sequence and Realism

| Dimension | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Concern ID** | E5a |
| **Concern Text** | "I agree with R2 that reducing merchant fees down to the cost of capital is unlikely (point 2c and point 2a, even though I do not expect you to simulate a counterfactual where credit cards are eliminated from the market, which is interesting, but maybe not as relevant in the current environment). The referee therefore suggests a more nuanced reduction sequence that would also illustrate the key features of the model better, as requested by R4." |
| **Type** | Counterfactual realism |
| **Manuscript Location** | counterfactuals.tex:10-15 |
| **Manuscript Quote** | "In my main counterfactual, I cap credit and debit card merchant fees at my baseline estimate of the cost of cash, \scalarinput{param_est_cashcost_pass_baseline} bps. This level of fee regulation aligns with the theoretical work of \textcite{Rochet.Tirole2011}, who show that capping both credit and debit card merchant fees at the cost of cash is welfare-optimal in a model with homogeneous merchants." (lines 10-14)<br><br>Footnote mentions "intermediate 95 bp cap (Canadian regulation)" |
| **Address Status** | **Fully addressed** |
| **Justification** | Author defends the main counterfactual (fees to cost of cash) with theoretical justification (Rochet-Tirole 2011 welfare optimality) and provides intermediate scenario (95 bp Canadian-style cap) in appendix/footnote. The cost-of-cash cap is not arbitrary—it's the theoretically optimal benchmark.<br><br>Seim's concern was that "cost of capital" reduction is unrealistic. Author clarifies it's cost of CASH (not capital), which is the relevant theoretical benchmark. The intermediate Canadian scenario addresses the "more nuanced reduction sequence" request. This responds appropriately to the substance of Seim's concern. |

### E5b: Fee Cap Channel Decomposition

| Dimension | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Concern ID** | E5b |
| **Concern Text** | "In the spirit of better illustrating model behavior, I think R1's suggestion of decomposing the fee cap effect into different channels would be very useful." |
| **Type** | Counterfactual analysis |
| **Manuscript Location** | counterfactuals.tex:49-59 (Table \ref{tab:welfare-decomp}) |
| **Manuscript Quote** | "Table \ref{tab:welfare-decomp} shows where the welfare gain comes from. Lower fees pass through to retail prices, benefiting all consumers by \$97B. This is offset by \$83B in lost rewards. Consumers gain \$15B from reduced credit aversion---the non-pecuniary cost of using credit cards." |
| **Address Status** | **Fully addressed** |
| **Justification** | Decomposition table explicitly breaks down fee cap effects into: (1) retail price pass-through ($97B), (2) lost rewards (-$83B), (3) reduced credit aversion ($15B), (4) card acceptance changes. This directly addresses R1's suggestion endorsed by Seim. The decomposition illustrates how different channels contribute to total welfare impact. |

### E5c: New Payment Methods and Substitution

| Dimension | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Concern ID** | E5c |
| **Concern Text** | "Allowing for substitution between payment types may increase the role of new payment methods (R2 point 2d). Depending on your ability to adopt the above suggestions, you might be able to engage more with this or at a minimum note that demand limits the impact of new payment methods." |
| **Type** | Counterfactual |
| **Manuscript Location** | counterfactuals.tex:139-141 (Public options discussion) |
| **Manuscript Quote** | "A public option---whether CBDCs \parencite{Shin2021,Usher.etal2021} or FedNow \parencite{FederalReserve2022}---generates only \$1.9 billion in welfare gains, less than uncapping debit fees (\$7B). Public networks with zero rewards cannot compete when consumers demand rewards." |
| **Address Status** | **Partially addressed** |
| **Justification** | Author discusses new payment methods (public options) and notes demand constraints limit their impact ("cannot compete when consumers demand rewards"). However, this discussion is NOT explicitly linked to the credit-debit substitution assumption.<br><br>Seim's point: IF you introduce credit-debit substitution (E4a), THEN new payment methods might become more important. The author added substitution robustness (E4a fully addressed) but didn't explicitly connect this to new payment method penetration in counterfactuals.<br><br>Given Seim's hedged language ("might be able to engage more" / "at a minimum note"), the current treatment is probably acceptable. The minimum requirement (noting demand limits) is met. |

### E5d: Consumer Multihoming Investigation

| Dimension | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Concern ID** | E5d |
| **Concern Text** | "I also like R1's suggestion to investigate the importance of consumer multihoming, which would speak to the broader two-sided markets literature. That said, if you find that this takes you too far afield from presenting a coherent story with the counterfactuals, I would also be fine with leaving this point for future work." |
| **Type** | Counterfactual |
| **Manuscript Location** | counterfactuals.tex:119-124 (Dual routing counterfactual) |
| **Manuscript Quote** | "Consumer multi-homing offers a market alternative to fee caps. If consumers hold cards from multiple networks, merchants can route to cheaper options, intensifying fee competition \parencite{Teh.etal2022}. I model a 15 bps reward increase that raises multi-homing from 60\% to 85\%." |
| **Address Status** | **Fully addressed** |
| **Justification** | Author includes a multihoming counterfactual examining how increased consumer multihoming (60% → 85%) affects equilibrium outcomes. This speaks directly to two-sided markets literature and addresses R1's suggestion endorsed by Seim.<br><br>Seim offered an explicit out ("fine with leaving this point for future work"), but the author chose to include it. This is commendable and exceeds the minimum requirement. |

### E5e: Baseline Scenario Clarity

| Dimension | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Concern ID** | E5e |
| **Concern Text** | "Lastly, R4 asks about unregulated optimal behavior. My guess was that this serves as the baseline for the counterfactuals already, but please correct me if I am wrong." |
| **Type** | Counterfactual |
| **Manuscript Location** | counterfactuals.tex:17 |
| **Manuscript Quote** | "When computing the counterfactual, I hold fixed consumers' preferences $\beta_i$, baseline income $y$, and merchants' sales benefits to card consumers $\gamma$. Consumer adoption, merchant acceptance, retail prices, and network prices can adjust." |
| **Address Status** | **Partially addressed** |
| **Justification** | Author describes the computational approach (what's held fixed vs. what adjusts) but doesn't explicitly define the baseline scenario. Is it: (a) Status quo 2019 equilibrium with observed fees/rewards? (b) Competitive equilibrium under current regulation? (c) Unregulated optimal?<br><br>The procedural description exists, but the conceptual label is missing. Seim asks "please correct me if I am wrong" and conjectures "unregulated optimal... serves as the baseline already." The author should explicitly confirm or correct this conjecture.<br><br>**Needed:** Statement like "Our baseline scenario is the 2019 competitive equilibrium under current regulation, where networks set fees and rewards to maximize profits subject to existing debit fee caps (Durbin Amendment). This serves as the comparison point for all counterfactual policies." |

## EXPOSITION CONCERNS (Introduction, Model, Appendix)

### E6a: General Writing and Accessibility

| Dimension | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Concern ID** | E6a |
| **Concern Text** | Editor and Frank Verboven express concerns about overall exposition, accessibility to non-specialists, and assumption that readers know payment institutions. Specific issues: (1) First page mentions "poorly designed price regulations" but is vague; (2) Second page refers to Durbin Amendment findings without context; (3) Paper reads as job market paper with excessive institutional detail. |
| **Type** | Writing and audience |
| **Manuscript Location** | intro.tex:1-100 |
| **Manuscript Quote** | "High market concentration and profit margins usually signal insufficient competition. In the U.S., Visa and Mastercard (MC) process 80\% of card transactions and earn operating margins above 60\% \parencite{Visa2020}. These facts have motivated two decades of litigation and legislation aimed at lowering the fees that merchants pay to accept cards, which totalled \$120 billion in 2019 \parencite{Nilson2020}.\footnote{Key policy interventions include the 2011 Durbin Amendment, the 2022 Credit Card Competition Act \parencite{Andriotis2022}, and the 2024 DOJ lawsuit against Visa \parencite{Au-Yeung2024}.}" (lines 4-6) |
| **Address Status** | **Partially addressed** |
| **Justification** | **Improvements made:** Introduction now opens with clear motivation (concentration, margins, $120B fees) before diving into two-sided market complications. Durbin Amendment mentioned in footnote on first page, providing earlier context than previous version.<br><br>**Remaining issues:** (1) The phrase "poorly designed price regulations" that Verboven flagged does NOT appear in current intro—either it was removed or never existed in this section. (2) Durbin findings (30% debit volume decline) appear on page 2-3 in reduced-form facts section, but institutional explanation of the Amendment itself is still deferred.<br><br>**What's still needed:** More upfront explanation of what Durbin Amendment actually did before presenting empirical results. Current treatment assumes readers know "Durbin = debit fee cap" without explaining the policy mechanism.<br><br>Seim's broader concern about "job market paper" feel (excessive institutional detail) requires holistic assessment beyond intro. Intro appears reasonably streamlined, but Model and Data sections may still contain tangential material. |

---

### E6b: Data Capabilities and Limitations Clarity

| Dimension | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Concern ID** | E6b |
| **Concern Text** | "Please take a stab at further tightening the paper's exposition with the objective of (a) clarifying what can and cannot be done with the data at hand..." |
| **Type** | Writing |
| **Manuscript Location** | NOT FOUND in introduction or early sections |
| **Manuscript Quote** | *No upfront statement about data capabilities/limitations found* |
| **Address Status** | **Not addressed** |
| **Justification** | The mapping document confirms "NOT FOUND - Need explicit early statement (Introduction or Data section opening): 'Our analysis is constrained by data availability. Rich consumer-level transaction data enable precise estimation of consumer preferences. However, merchant-level data on pricing and acceptance are limited, requiring us to infer merchant behavior from aggregate patterns and a single grocer's acceptance decision.'"<br><br>This is the exposition equivalent of E3a (transparency about merchant data limitations). Without an upfront statement, readers don't understand why certain modeling choices were made until deep into technical sections. Early framing would manage expectations and contextualize subsequent methodological discussions. |

### E6c: Model Section Focus on Essential Features

| Dimension | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Concern ID** | E6c |
| **Concern Text** | "...and (b) focusing the paper on the essential pieces of the setting that are relevant for the modeling and the interpretation of your results." |
| **Type** | Writing and focus |
| **Manuscript Location** | model.tex:1-200 |
| **Manuscript Quote** | Model section appears streamlined with focus on: (1) three-stage game structure, (2) payment behavior at point of sale, (3) consumption over merchants, (4) merchant pricing/acceptance, (5) consumer adoption, (6) network pricing |
| **Address Status** | **Fully addressed** (tentative) |
| **Justification** | Based on the sample read (lines 1-100), model section appears focused on core features: multihoming structure, payment substitution patterns, merchant heterogeneity, competition. The exposition proceeds logically from micro (consumer payment choices) to macro (network competition).<br><br>**Caveat:** Full assessment requires reading complete model section (lines 100-end) to identify any tangential institutional details. From sampled text, structure appears clean and essential. The mapping document notes "Model section appears streamlined" with instruction to "check for tangential institutional detail to condense."<br><br>Tentatively marking as Fully addressed pending full section review. |

### E6d: Appendix Length and Content

| Dimension | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Concern ID** | E6d |
| **Concern Text** | "You may also want to shorten the footnotes and shorten the Appendix, which contains further details that – while interesting – are not central to the substance of the paper (for example, the detailed section on price coherence). To the extent that a reader would like to engage with the Appendix material, I would recommend that you include only the most important material related to the data compilation and collection, the empirical estimation approach, and the model derivation." |
| **Type** | Writing |
| **Manuscript Location** | Appendix structure: Multiple appendices (A-C main, OA.1-OA.5 online); Price coherence in appendix_surcharging.tex (OA.2) |
| **Manuscript Quote** | N/A (structural assessment) |
| **Address Status** | **Fully addressed** |
| **Justification** | The mapping document notes: "Price coherence already in Online Appendix (not for publication); main appendices appear focused on essential material."<br><br>Author appropriately moved price coherence—the specific example Seim mentioned as "interesting but not central"—to Online Appendix (OA.2), which won't appear in published version. Main appendices (A-C) focus on: data compilation (appendix_data.tex), estimation (appendix_estimation.tex), reduced-form robustness (appendix_reduced.tex), model derivations (appendix_model.tex).<br><br>This structure aligns with Seim's guidance to retain "most important material related to data compilation and collection, empirical estimation approach, and model derivation" while removing tangential content. |

### E6e: Footnote Reduction

| Dimension | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Concern ID** | E6e |
| **Concern Text** | "You may also want to shorten the footnotes..." which "should be shortened; many contain non-essential detail." |
| **Type** | Writing |
| **Manuscript Location** | Throughout manuscript |
| **Manuscript Quote** | N/A (requires manual review of all footnotes) |
| **Address Status** | **Cannot assess without full review** |
| **Justification** | The mapping document notes "REQUIRES MANUAL REVIEW - Footnotes throughout manuscript need review for length and essentiality."<br><br>From sampled sections (intro.tex, model.tex, reducedform.tex), footnotes appear substantive but relatively concise. Example footnotes: (1) Durbin robustness reference (reducedform.tex:37-39), (2) Broader response interpretation (reducedform.tex:41-45), (3) Credit aversion survey evidence (intro.tex:26-28).<br><br>These footnotes contain essential clarifications rather than tangential asides. However, comprehensive assessment requires reviewing ALL footnotes across entire manuscript. Cannot assign definitive status without complete review. |

---

### E6f: Collusion Discussion (Knittel-Stango)

| Dimension | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Concern ID** | E6f |
| **Concern Text** | "Lastly, Frank Verboven suggests connecting with Knittel and Stango's paper 'Price Ceilings as Focal Points for Tacit Collusion' (AER 2003) on price ceilings as focal points for collusion in credit card markets. Since this relates closely to price caps, it may be useful to discuss whether institutions have changed since their analysis and whether caps may create a risk of collusion in your setting (not at all to be dealt with, but to mention as a caveat)." |
| **Type** | Exposition / Theoretical connection |
| **Manuscript Location** | counterfactuals.tex:148 |
| **Manuscript Quote** | "An important caveat is that price ceilings may facilitate tacit collusion. Historical evidence supports this concern. \textcite{Knittel.Stango2003} document that, before the Credit CARD Act, state usury ceilings on credit card interest rates served as pricing focal points. Issuers clustered at ceiling rates rather than competing downward. Merchant fee caps risk similar collusion. If regulated fees gravitate toward ceiling levels rather than competitive floors, welfare gains would diminish substantially." |
| **Address Status** | **Fully addressed** |
| **Justification** | Author includes explicit discussion of Knittel-Stango (2003) collusion risk, applies it to merchant fee cap context, and acknowledges potential welfare implications if caps become focal points for collusion rather than competitive ceilings. This caveat appears in counterfactuals section where fee caps are analyzed, exactly as Seim suggested ("mention as a caveat").<br><br>The discussion is appropriately scoped—author doesn't attempt to model collusion (Seim: "not at all to be dealt with") but acknowledges the risk and its potential to reduce welfare gains. |

### E7: AEA Replication Policy Compliance

| Dimension | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Concern ID** | E7 |
| **Concern Text** | "I would also like to remind you that the paper will ultimately need to follow the AEA data & replication policy. So, making sure your code is well documented and adheres to this policy will save you extra work down the road. It also minimizes the chance that your estimates change at a late stage in the review process, with all the resulting complications that happen due to any such changes." |
| **Type** | Code/data governance |
| **Manuscript Location** | main.tex:23-25 (Nielsen disclosure); code repository (unknown status) |
| **Manuscript Quote** | Standard Kilts Center disclosure present (quoted in E2b above) |
| **Address Status** | **Partially addressed** |
| **Justification** | Standard data disclosures are present in manuscript. However, Seim's concern is primarily about CODE documentation and compliance, not just data acknowledgments.<br><br>The mapping document notes "Code documentation status unknown (requires code repository review)." Without access to the replication package, cannot assess whether: (1) Code is well-documented, (2) README files explain workflow, (3) Dependencies are specified, (4) Code adheres to AEA standards.<br><br>This is a process concern that typically can't be verified from manuscript alone. Author should ensure code repository meets AEA standards before resubmission, but evidence of compliance won't appear in the paper itself. |

## PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR COVER LETTER

When resubmitting, the cover letter should:

### Must Address (High Priority Gaps):

1. **E3a-E3c cluster**: Add transparency discussion in Model/Estimation sections acknowledging that:
   - Merchant data limitations constrain modeling flexibility
   - σ identification uses single merchant (calibration-like)
   - Fixed costs not separately identified from heterogeneity
   - These are acknowledged shortcomings, not design choices

2. **E4b**: Reference credit constraint robustness in main text and evaluate Seim's conjecture

3. **E4c**: Add paragraph on information environment in Model section

4. **E6b**: Add upfront data capabilities/limitations statement

### Should Clarify (Partial Addresses):

5. **E1b**: Explain why issuer strategic response evidence wasn't provided (data constraints?)

6. **E2b**: Confirm Kilts Center approval for single grocery store analysis

7. **E5e**: Explicitly define baseline scenario (status quo vs. unregulated optimal)

8. **E6a**: Highlight intro improvements and check for remaining "job market paper" feel

### Can Note as Completed:

9. List the 11 fully addressed concerns with brief descriptions of changes made

10. Emphasize strongest responses (E4a, E5b, E5d, E6f) where author exceeded requirements

## FINAL ASSESSMENT

**Overall verdict: PARTIAL**

The manuscript demonstrates substantial effort and addresses roughly half the concerns fully. However, critical transparency gaps remain in the modeling section (E3a-E3c cluster), which was Seim's overarching concern. These are HIGH PRIORITY issues that Seim explicitly emphasized: "At a high level, the paper needs to be more open about the fact that..."

**Why this matters:** Seim's editorial philosophy values honesty about constraints over apparent comprehensiveness. The failure to add explicit transparency statements about merchant data limitations, calibration vs. estimation, and fixed cost non-identification suggests the author may have missed the spirit of Seim's feedback—which is to be MORE transparent, not MORE defensive.

**Path forward:** The remaining gaps are all EXPOSITION issues that don't require new analysis. Adding 4-5 paragraphs of honest discussion about data constraints and modeling limitations would likely satisfy Seim's concerns and move the paper toward acceptance.

**Tone for cover letter:** Acknowledge where transparency fell short in previous revision, commit to explicit statements about limitations, and demonstrate understanding that Seim values intellectual honesty over technical perfection.

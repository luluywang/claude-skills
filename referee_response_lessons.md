# 20 Principles for Referee Responses (from manual pass on 3b826ad)

## Tone and framing
1. **Cut filler and throat-clearing.** Delete "I apologize," "The referee raises an important point," "This is an interesting thought experiment." Just answer.
2. **Use "you" when addressing referees.** More collegial than "The referee is correct."
3. **Thank referees only for genuinely helpful suggestions, and say why.** Reserve thanks for ideas that actually improved the paper (e.g., dual routing counterfactual).

## Honesty and precision
4. **Be honest about what the model can't do.** Don't attempt answers the model can't support. Say "The model is not well-suited to answer this question" when appropriate.
5. **Be specific about limitations—name the exact constraint.** Not "the data are not precise enough" but "the DCPC has limited AmEx coverage." Not "a small number of events" but "only two clear cases."
6. **Don't fabricate verification steps.** Never claim "I have computed X to verify Y" if you haven't.
7. **Distinguish claims from evidence—hedge mechanisms, not facts.** "While the data does not provide direct evidence on the mechanism, one possibility consistent with testimony is..."

## Structure and substance
8. **Concede when the referee is right, then redirect.** Acknowledge valid concerns before pivoting to where they don't apply.
9. **Lead with the economic mechanism, not procedural descriptions.** Not "I have revised the discussion of X" but the actual identification argument.
10. **Consolidate related comments into a single reply.** Groups of 2-3 related comments get one unified answer.
11. **Tailor responses to each referee's framing.** Same logical structure, different emphasis based on each referee's specific concern.
12. **Delete self-congratulatory framing.** Remove "This approach has two main advantages..." Let evidence speak for itself.

## Exposition
13. **Replace bullet-point lists with flowing prose that builds intuition.**
14. **Give concrete examples of what would violate an identifying assumption.** E.g., a co-branded card campaign that shifts both acceptance and card holdings.
15. **Use precise cross-references.** Not "I clarified this in the text" but "see footnote~\ref{foot:surcharge-equivalence}."
16. **Make citations do work—explain why you're citing.** Not just parenthetical; say "because past work shows X \parencite{Y}."

## Intellectual positioning
17. **Reference existing literature rather than re-derive known results.** "The theoretical literature has already established this... I take the benchmark and evaluate it directly."
18. **State the paper's contribution clearly—what it adds vs. what it borrows.**

## Precision in the paper itself
19. **Choose words that reflect the model's actual objects.** "Use" not "carry" when the model is about usage, not ownership.
20. **Move material to where it belongs in the paper,** not just the response letter. Key reasoning should be in footnotes/text of the actual paper.

# Comprehensive Writing Principles for Economics Papers
## Synthesized from McCloskey, Cochrane, and Chaubey

---

## I. STRUCTURAL PRINCIPLES

### A. Overall Organization: The Inverted Pyramid

**Core Principle**: Organize papers in "triangular" or "newspaper" style, not "joke" or "novel" style. Put the punchline first, then fill in details for readers who continue.

**From Cochrane**:
> "Notice how newspapers start with the most important part, then fill in background later for the readers who kept going and want more details. A good joke or a mystery novel has a long windup to the final punchline. Don't write papers like that — put the punchline right up front and then slowly explain the joke."

**From Chaubey (RAP Framework)**:
> "Descending structure allows more types of readers to learn from your writing... Barbara Minto's Pyramid Principle: analytical writing can be structured as a logical dialog between the reader and the writer, and the reader prefers being allowed to descend from the high level to the details."

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- State your central contribution in the first paragraph
- Never make readers wait until Table 12 or the conclusion to learn your main finding
- The vast majority of Ph.D. papers get this wrong—they reveal the contribution only at the end
- Think of readers as busy and impatient who will skim rather than read linearly

---

### B. The Central Contribution

**Core Principle**: Distill your paper to one central and novel contribution. Everything else supports this.

**From Cochrane**:
> "Figure out the one central and novel contribution of your paper. Write this down in one paragraph... Distilling your one central contribution will take some thought. It will cause some pain, because you will start to realize how much you're going to have to throw out."

**From Chaubey (RAP Framework)**:
> "RAP is the paper's main argument distilled from its key details."
> - **R (Research question)**: Think of R as a version of the research question that the reader might be able to articulate
> - **A (Answer)**: While R links your argument to reader's concerns, A anchors it to what the paper actually delivers
> - **P (Positioning)**: Allow readers to see a space in the literature that R and A occupy

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- Write your contribution concretely, not abstractly ("Two easily measured variables, size and book-to-market equity..." not "I analyzed data and found interesting results")
- The RAP should run through the paper like its spine, linking parts into a whole
- Try different RAPs—different combinations appeal to different audiences
- Common orderings: RPA, RAP, ARP (depending on what readers need most)

---

### C. Introduction Structure

**Core Principle**: Start with your contribution, not with philosophy, motivation, or literature review.

**From Cochrane**:
> "The introduction should start with what you do in this paper, the major contribution... Do not start with philosophy, 'Financial economists have long wondered if markets are efficient.' Do not start with 'The finance literature has long been interested in x.'"

**From Chaubey**:
> "Introductions should have two parts. Part 1 should provoke curiosity; help the reader learn about the context of the paper. Part 2 should help readers get ready for the main business of the paper."

**From McCloskey**:
> "Never start a paper with that all-purpose filler for the bankrupt imagination, 'This paper...'"

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- First sentence states your central contribution with the fact behind the result
- Keep introductions to 3 pages maximum
- **Part 1**: Provoke curiosity, establish context (use P from RAP framework)
- **Part 2**: Help readers visualize what's coming (follow RAP structure)
- Avoid "throat-clearing" sentences about how important the topic is to public policy
- Bridge paragraph between Parts 1 and 2 to transition from what others do to what you do
- No "roadmap paragraphs" listing section numbers—readers will figure it out

---

### D. Literature Review Placement and Purpose

**Core Principle**: Literature review comes AFTER you've explained your contribution, not before.

**From Cochrane**:
> "Do not start your introduction with a page and a half of other literature. First, your readers are most interested in just figuring out what you do. They can't start wondering if it's better than what others have done until they understand what you do."

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- Make it a separate section so people can skip it if uninterested
- Focus on 2-3 closest current papers
- Give proper credit to people who deserve priority
- Be generous in citations—you don't need to say everyone else was wrong
- Literature reviews have gotten out of hand; avoid Journal of Economic Literature-style comprehensive reviews
- Remember: most readers haven't read the other papers and don't know the literature

---

### E. Getting to the Main Result Quickly

**Core Principle**: There should be nothing before the main result that a reader does not need to know in order to understand the main result.

**From Cochrane**:
> "Your task now is to get to the central result as fast as possible. Most papers do precisely the opposite: They have a long motivation, a long literature review, a big complex model that then gets ignored, descriptive statistics, preliminary results, a side discussion or two and then finally Table 12 of 'main estimates.' By then we're all asleep."

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- No warm-up exercises before main results
- No extensive data description (especially of well-known datasets)
- No preliminary estimates or replication of others' work
- No motivation via all your failures
- Theory should be the minimum required to understand empirical results
- Don't write a "general" model then specialize it—just work out the specialized model you take to data
- Follow main result with graphs/tables giving intuition and showing robustness

---

### F. Theory Sections

**Core Principle**: Theory serves the empirical work. Keep it minimal and specific.

**From Cochrane**:
> "The theory is there to help understand the empirical work... Do not write a 'general' model and then 'for the empirical work, we now specialize the general shock process to an AR(1)...' Work out only the specialized model that you actually take to data."

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- Ask: "Does this paper expand our knowledge of economic theory?" If no, minimize theory
- Only include theory needed to understand empirical results
- Don't prove theorems on blackboards that don't connect to empirical work
- Avoid "illustrative" work—either do real empirical work or none at all

---

### G. Conclusions

**Core Principle**: Conclusions should be short or omitted entirely if you've explained your contribution well.

**From Cochrane**:
> "Really, a conclusions section should not be necessary. If you did a good job of explaining your contribution in understandable prose in the introduction, and then documenting those claims in the body of the paper... then saying it all over again is pointless."

**From McCloskey**:
> "Avoid overtures, and do not give elaborate summaries of what you have said. Never repeat without apologizing for it ('as I said earlier'; or merely 'again')."

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- Keep conclusions short and sweet
- Do not restate all findings—one statement in abstract, one in intro, once in body is enough
- Can include short paragraph acknowledging limitations
- Don't write grant applications outlining future research plans
- Don't speculate—reader wants facts not opinions

---

### H. Paragraph Structure

**Core Principle**: Paragraphs should have points and should answer questions provoked by preceding text.

**From Chaubey**:
> "Paragraphs should answer the question provoked by the takeaway or a main question sparked by the prior paragraph... The first sentence of each paragraph should offer the paragraph's RAP-relevant main message while provoking follow-up questions that will be answered in its body."

**From McCloskey**:
> "The paragraph should be a more or less complete discussion of one topic... You will want occasionally to pause for various reasons, having completed a bit of discussion, shifting the tone perhaps or simply giving the reader a break."

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- First sentence should convey an idea, not detail
- First sentence properties: (1) includes main message, (2) links to overall story, (3) provokes follow-up questions
- 5-6 sentences per paragraph is ideal
- Avoid burying key ideas at the bottom of paragraphs (we write to refine thoughts, so ideas unfortunately end up at the bottom)
- Test coherence: extract first sentences of all paragraphs—do they tell a coherent story?
- First sentence of each paragraph should carry forward at least one phrase from previous first sentence
- Don't make paragraphs too long (readers skip when attention wanders) or too short (creates breathless quality)

---

### I. Headings and Takeaways

**Core Principle**: Headings should answer readers' basic questions, not just organize your thoughts.

**From Chaubey**:
> "Write headings with key takeaways following them. Takeaways should be less than 4 sentences for sections, and less than 2 sentences per section. A reader who skims section headings and their takeaways should know where the main questions they have after seeing the argument will be answered."

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- Headings should help readers navigate, not just organize your thoughts
- Use key words consistently throughout the paper
- Write subheadings by adding specifics to key words
- Takeaways should include: (1) main message of heading, (2) link to overall story using key words, (3) preparation for details to follow, (4) provocation of follow-up questions
- Ask readers what order they expect questions answered in
- With good outline, uninformed readers should be able to: identify main argument, summarize how it's supported, find answers to their questions

---

### J. Arrangement and Coherence

**Core Principle**: Make writing hang together through repetition and logical flow, not through traffic signals.

**From McCloskey**:
> "The Rule of Coherence: make writing hang together. The reader can understand writing that hangs together, from phrases up to entire books. She can't understand writing filled with irrelevancies."

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- Link each sentence to the previous one through repeated words or concepts
- Use transitive writing: (AB)(BC)(CD) not (AB ZYX)(MNOP)(BJKLC)
- Violate the schoolmarm's rule—DO repeat words to link sentences
- Don't use traffic signals at start of sentences (Indeed, However, Furthermore, Therefore)
- A newspaper editor's advice: "It doesn't much matter what your first sentence is. It doesn't even much matter what the second is. But the third damn well better follow from the first and second."
- Avoid clumsy linking with "not only... but also"
- Achieve coherence through repetition, not through signal words
- Use pronouns ("it," "them") to relieve monotony while maintaining links

---

## II. STYLISTIC PRINCIPLES

### A. Clarity as the Golden Rule

**Core Principle**: Be clear. Clarity is a social matter—if the reader thinks it's unclear, it is, by definition.

**From McCloskey**:
> "Therefore one ought to take care to write not merely so that the reader can understand but so that he cannot possibly misunderstand" (Quintilian, Book VIII, ii, 24).

**From Popper (quoted by McCloskey)**:
> "I learned never to defend anything I had written against the accusation that it is not clear enough. If a conscientious reader finds a passage unclear, it has to be re-written."

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- Clarity = speed directed at the point
- Bad writing makes you stop with puzzles, sends you in irrelevant directions
- Read your own writing cold a week after drafting
- If readers have trouble, they give up—lack of clarity is selfish
- The reader is sovereign like the consumer
- Every sentence should mean something concrete
- Avoid raising expectations you don't fulfill

---

### B. Writing is Thinking

**Core Principle**: Content and style cannot be separated. Writing is how you think through details.

**From McCloskey**:
> "The production function for thinking cannot be written as the sum of two subfunctions, one producing 'results' and the other 'writing them up.' The function is not separable. You do not learn the details of an argument until writing it in detail, and in writing the details you uncover flaws in the fundamentals."

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- Write early rather than late
- Writing is a way of thinking—don't wait until research is done to begin writing
- Be writing all the time, working on a page or two here, a section there
- Research is writing
- You discover truths you didn't know you had through writing
- Writing helps refine fuzzy notions into precise descriptions
- Like mathematics, writing is both instrument of communication and instrument of thought

---

### C. Conciseness

**Core Principle**: Keep it short. Every word must count.

**From Cochrane**:
> "Keep the paper as short as possible. Every word must count. As you edit the paper ask yourself constantly, 'can I make the same point in less space?' and 'Do I really have to say this?' Final papers should be no more than 40 pages."

**From Sydney Smith (quoted by McCloskey)**:
> "In composing, as a general rule, run your pen through every other word you have written; you have no idea what vigour it will give to your style."

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- Don't repeat things (if you've said it once, don't say it again)
- "In other words" is a sign of trouble—go back and say it once, right
- Avoid elegant variation (calling the same thing by different names)
- Strike out most adjectives and adverbs in revision
- Delete "the existence of" and just name the thing
- Brevity is the soul of clarity
- Three pages is a good limit for introductions
- Abstracts: 100-150 words maximum

---

### D. Concreteness

**Core Principle**: Write concretely, not abstractly. Use specific examples rather than generalizations.

**From McCloskey**:
> "Definiteness is concrete. Prefer Pepperidge Farm to bread, bread to widgets, and widgets to X. Bad writers in economics sometimes use abstraction because they have nothing to say and don't want the fact to become too plain."

**From Cochrane**:
> "Writing should be concrete, not abstract."

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- Singular words are more concrete than plurals
- Translation is easier from concrete examples UP to abstract principles than vice versa
- Much economic writing reads like code: "%&*marginal##$$processof&%$#@#$%!structure"
- Example: "machines and men" not "capital and labor"; "sheep and wheat" not "natural resource-oriented exports"
- Example: "Spanish prices began to rise before the treasure came" not "the commencement of the Spanish Price Revolution antedated the inflow of treasure"
- Provide concrete numbers: "In a regression of x on y, controlling for z, the coefficient is q" not just "My results show the pecking-order theory is rejected"

---

### E. Plain Language over Jargon

**Core Principle**: Use Anglo-Saxon words over Latinate abstractions. Avoid technical jargon and five-dollar words.

**From McCloskey**:
> "Anglo-Saxon words (need, someone, feels, buys, bread, bake) have often acquired a concreteness through homely use that more recent and more scholarly coinages from Latin or Greek have not (integrative, consequences, structural, differentiation)."

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- "Use" not "utilize"
- "Several" not "diverse"
- "People" not "agents" or "individuals"
- Avoid: via, comprise, hypothesize, finalize, implement, critique
- "It's a good bet that once a place gets poor it will stay poor" not "Geographical and cultural factors function to spatially confine growth to specific regions"
- Jargon often hides five-cent thoughts: "current period responses" = "what people do now"
- The "time inconsistency problem" = the economics of changing one's mind
- Avoid teutonisms (noun-stacking): "private wealth-seeking activity" should be "the seeking of wealth" or just "seeking wealth"
- Untie the knot: "factor price equalization" → "the equalization of the prices of factors"

---

### F. Active Voice and Verbs

**Core Principle**: Use active verbs and take responsibility for what you're writing.

**From Cochrane**:
> "Use active tense. Not: 'it is assumed that τ = 3', 'data were constructed as follows..' Gee, I wonder who did that assuming and constructing? Search for 'is' and 'are' in the document to root out every single passive sentence."

**From McCloskey**:
> "Use active verbs: not 'active verbs should be used,' which is cowardice, hiding the user in the passive voice. Rather: 'you should use active verbs.'"

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- "I assume that τ = 3" not "it is assumed that τ = 3"
- "I construct the data as follows" not "data were constructed as follows"
- Use "I" for single-authored papers (not the royal "we")
- Use "we" to mean "you (the reader) and I"
- Imperative is good for mathematical arguments: "then divide both sides by x" not "both sides are then divided by x"
- Circle every "is" in your writing—if the page looks like acne, replace with action verbs
- Find the action in a sentence and express it in a verb
- Nominalization saps vigor: "There is a data reanalysis need" → "We must reanalyze our data"
- Much bad writing comes from trying to avoid responsibility

---

### G. Sentence Structure

**Core Principle**: Use normal sentence structure (subject-verb-object). Keep sentences complete and focused.

**From Cochrane**:
> "Use the normal sentence structure: subject, verb, object. Not: 'The insurance mechanisms that agents utilize to smooth consumption in the face of transitory earnings fluctuations are diverse' Instead: 'People use a variety of insurance mechanisms to smooth consumption.'"

**From McCloskey (Gardner's Rule)**:
> "Vary your sentences by how much you put into each [of the three parts: subject, verb, object], and in each sentence choose only one of the three parts for elaboration."

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- Every sentence should have subject, verb, and object
- Don't overburden all three parts—vary which part is complex
- Avoid straggling sentences that add one more idea at the last minute
- Listen for monotonously long or short sentences
- Put important matter at the END of the sentence (that's the emphatic position)
- Put less important things in the middle or the trash
- The end of the sentence is where emphasis belongs
- Second in emphasis: the beginning
- Avoid breaking the flow with parenthetical remarks—put them at end if important, beginning if not

---

### H. Word Choice and Usage

**Core Principle**: Choose precise words. Avoid vague nouns, weak verbs, and useless modifiers.

**Vague nouns to avoid** (McCloskey):
- concept → idea, notion, thought
- data (overused) → facts, statistics, information, observations
- function (meaning "role")
- situation → position, condition
- individuals → people
- agents → people
- structure (usually means nothing)
- process (usually empty and can be struck out)
- time frame → time

**Weak/pretentious verbs to avoid**:
- critique → criticize, comment on
- implement (Washingtonese)
- comprise → include, consist of
- analyze (overused) → discuss, examine
- hypothesize → suppose, expect
- state (in sense of "say") → say

**Useless adjectives**:
- interesting (made weak by sarcastic use)
- kind of, sort of, type of (vague)
- former/latter (makes reader look back)
- intra/inter (use "within" and "between")

**Useless adverbs**:
- very (strike it out almost always)
- respectively (signals lack of parallel structure)
- fortunately, interestingly (cheap opinion)
- absolutely, purely, literally (usually misused)

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- Use one word to mean one thing consistently (avoid elegant variation)
- Don't use adjectives to describe your own work ("striking results," "very significant")
- No double adjectives ("very novel")
- Strike "It is usually the case that" and everything before "that"
- Strike "It should be noted that"—just say what you want to say
- Strike "A comment is in order at this point"—just make the comment

---

### I. Tone and Voice

**Core Principle**: Choose an appropriate implied author and maintain a reasonable, honest tone.

**From McCloskey**:
> "The tone of the writing and much of its clarity depends on choosing and then keeping an appropriate implied author... The successful piece will have an author the reader can tolerate."

**From Mills (quoted by McCloskey)**:
> "Desire for status is one reason why academic men slip so readily into unintelligibility... To overcome the academic prose you have first to overcome the academic pose."

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- Don't adopt The Scientist pose or use pompously unintelligible academic writing
- Relax, take off the mask, be yourself
- Be nice, not servile or pompous
- Avoid invective: "This is pure nonsense," "absolutely no evidence," "fanciful hypothesis"
- Indignation arouses sympathy for your target, not agreement with you (Adam Smith)
- Use present tense usually ("Fama and French 1993 find that")
- Keep tense consistent
- Humor and wit are acceptable—even puns can cheer a grader
- Personality should show through (within reason)
- Don't air opinions gratuitously or intemperately
- Wit compensates for tendentiousness (see Mencken, Stigler)

---

### J. Reading Aloud

**Core Principle**: Read your writing out loud to detect bad spots.

**From McCloskey**:
> "Reading out loud is a powerful technique of revision. By reading out loud you hear your writing as others hear it internally, and if your ear is good you'll detect the bad spots."

**From Hemingway (quoted by McCloskey)**:
> "The writer needs a built-in, shockproof bullshit detector."

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- Decide when to use contractions by reading aloud
- Pick up unintentional rhymes (at times your lines will chime)
- Don't write anything you'd be embarrassed to read aloud to intended audience
- If you blush hearing an over-fancy sentence or jargony word, change it
- Train your ear by reading best old books
- Read poetry out loud, memorize some
- Read good writing to improve your ear
- Your ear should ring with English literature

---

### K. Avoiding Boilerplate

**Core Principle**: Avoid prefabricated, predictable prose. Get to the point.

**From McCloskey**:
> "Boilerplate in prose is all that is prefabricated and predictable. It's common in economic prose."

**Examples of boilerplate**:
- "This paper..." (never start with this)
- Excessive introduction and summarization
- Table-of-contents paragraphs ("The outline of this paper is as follows")
- "Background" that's really padding
- Redoing for many repetitive cases what one well-chosen case shows
- Econometric chatter copied from textbooks
- Rederivations of necessary conditions for consumer equilibrium
- Routine mathematical passages
- Hackneyed theoretical formulations

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- Never start with "This paper..."
- No table-of-contents paragraphs—readers skip them or can't understand until they've read the paper
- Miss Jones's rule is wrong: NOT "Tell them what you're going to say; say it; tell them what you said"
- Never repeat without apologizing ("as I said earlier" or "again")
- Avoid overtures
- If you read a lot and thought through your question, you'll have plenty to say; if not, no amount of padding will fool professors/bosses

---

### L. Punctuation

**Core Principle**: Use punctuation to guide reading pace, not by rigid rules.

**From McCloskey**:
> "Punctuate by ear rather than by rule, and to insert a comma, as after 'rule' here, where the pause in speaking seems to want it or where you as a reader get lost without it."

**Guidelines**:
- **Comma splice** is an error: "The citizens lived in fear, the result was poor economic growth" → need period, semicolon, colon, or conjunction
- **Colon** (:) means "to be specific" or introduces illustration
- **Semicolon** (;) means "furthermore" or introduces parallel remark
- **Semicolon** also used as supercomma in long series
- Delete most commas before "the"—the signals new phrase well enough
- Avoid overuse of commas (slows reading pace)
- Don't separate subject from verb with comma
- **Dash** (—) is parenthesis in louder tone; can be overused to solve badly organized sentences
- One space after comma, semicolon, colon; two spaces after period, question mark, exclamation point (in typing)
- Quotation marks: close quote goes inside punctuation ("thus.")

---

### M. Word Order and Emphasis

**Core Principle**: The end of the sentence is the place of emphasis. Arrange words for maximum clarity and effect.

**From McCloskey**:
> "The most important rule of rearrangement is that the end of the sentence is the place of emphasis... The reader leaves the sentence with the last word ringing in her ears."

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- Put main idea at end of sentence, or secondarily at beginning
- Dump less important things in the middle or trash
- Putting trivial things at end weakens the sentence
- Tinker with sentence until it works
- Move adverbs around: "which is again merely another notation" → "which again is merely another notation"
- "Both elasticities are with respect to the price" not "the elasticities are both with respect to the price"
- Put modifiers close to words they modify
- Avoid breaking flow with parenthetical remarks mid-sentence
- Use longest portion at end of doublets and triplets: "Keynes and the Keynesians" (works); "faith, hope, and charity" (works)

---

### N. Repetition vs. Variation

**Core Principle**: Repeat key terms for clarity; avoid elegant variation that confuses readers.

**From McCloskey**:
> "Elegant Variation uses many words to mean one thing, with the result in the end that the reader, and even the writer, don't quite know what is being talked about."

**From Chaubey**:
> "Do not use interchangeable terms to refer to the same identity, this applies across a paragraph and across the whole paper."

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- Use ONE word to mean ONE thing—get your words and things lined up and keep them that way
- Express parallel ideas in parallel form (Strunk and White)
- Don't call "consumer" → "household" → "agent" in successive sentences
- One paper used in two pages: "industrialization," "growing structural differentiation," "economic and social development," "social and economic development," "development," "economic growth," "growth," "revolutionized means of production" (all meaning same thing!)
- Repetition brings clarity and unity to English
- Query every instance of variation—is it necessary or just showing off?
- Use key words consistently throughout the paper

---

### O. Pronouns and Reference

**Core Principle**: Make pronoun references crystal clear. Avoid ambiguity.

**From Cochrane**:
> "Clothe the naked 'this.' 'This shows that markets really are irrational...' This what? 'This' should always have something following it. 'This regression shows that....' is fine."

**From McCloskey**:
> "Another plague is this-ism. These bad writers think this reader needs repeated reminders that it is this idea, not that one, which is being discussed."

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- Circle all instances of "this" and "these"—take most of them out
- "This" should have noun following it: "this regression," "this result" not naked "this"
- Often plain "the" works better than "this"
- Use singulars and plurals to clarify reference: "An owner... earned from them [powers]... tenant farmers were willing to pay him [owner]"
- Assign gender to distinguish people you're discussing (writer as "she," reader as "he" or vice versa)
- Use capitals for concrete reference: "the Coase Theorem" clearer than "the proposition that..."
- People forget Greek letter definitions—remind them: "the elasticity of substitution θ equals 3"

---

## III. TECHNICAL ELEMENTS

### A. Tables and Figures

**From Cochrane**:
> "Each table should have a self-contained caption so that a skimming reader can understand the fact presented without having to go searching through the text."

**From McCloskey**:
> "The wretched tables and graphs in economics show how little economists care about expression. Tables and graphs are writing, and the usual rules of writing therefore apply."

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- **Self-contained captions**: Include enough info that skimming reader understands without searching text
- **Regression tables**: Caption should have equation and variable names, especially left-hand variable
- **No orphan numbers**: Every number in table must be discussed in text
- **Meaningful labels**: "Rich Budget Line" not "Locus QuERtY"; use spelled-out names, not computer acronyms
- **Significant digits**: 4.56783 ± 0.6789 should be 4.6 ± 0.7 (two to three digits plenty)
- **Sensible units**: Use percentages; report 2.3 rather than 0.0000023
- **Figures**: Give patterns better than tables; include verbal definition of each symbol
- **Label axes**, use sensible units
- Read Tufte's *Visual Display of Quantitative Information*
- Use declarative headings: "Conferences Should Happen in the Midwest" not "A Model of Transport Costs"

---

### B. Equations

**From McCloskey**:
> "It's clearer and no less scientific to say 'the regression was Quantity of Grain = 3.56 + 5.6 (Price of Grain) - 3.8 (Real Income)' than 'the regression was Q = 3.56 + 5.6P - 3.8Y, where Q is quantity of grain, P its price, and Y real income.'"

**From Halmos (quoted by McCloskey)**:
> "The author had to code his thought in [symbols] (I deny that anybody thinks in [such] terms), and the reader has to decode."

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- Use words in displayed equations when possible
- Anyone can retrieve algebra from words; reverse is pointlessly harder
- Even professional mathematicians don't think in pure symbols
- Keep displayed equations readable with meaningful variable names
- Define symbols clearly in easy-to-find place
- Remind readers of symbol meanings when you use them

---

### C. Footnotes and Appendices

**From Cochrane**:
> "Don't use footnotes for parenthetical comments. If it's important, put it in the text. If it's not important, delete it."

**From McCloskey**:
> "Footnotes should guide the reader to the sources. That's all."

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- **Footnotes**: Only for things typical reader can skip but few might want attached to current point
- Long lists of references, simple algebra, documentation are good candidates
- No breaking sentences with footnotes
- Not for side trips that break up flow
- **Appendices**: Great tool for robustness checks, general versions of models, extensive literature comments
- Eventually you'll dump much of appendix too
- Can summarize appendix material in paper and put full version on website
- Use appendices to get delicious but tangential material out of main paper

---

### D. Abstracts

**From Cochrane**:
> "Most journals allow 100-150 words. Obey this limit now. The main function of the abstract is to communicate the one central and novel contribution, which you just figured out."

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- 100-150 words maximum
- State what you FIND, not what you "look for"
- Be concrete: give actual results
- No mention of other literature
- Don't write "data are analyzed, theorems are proved, discussion is made"
- Example of good abstract: Fama-French 1992 starts with "Two easily measured variables, size and book-to-market equity, combine to capture the cross-sectional variation..."

---

### E. Citations and References

**From Cochrane**:
> "Be generous in your citations. You do not have to say that everyone else did it all wrong for your approach and improvements to be interesting."

**From McCloskey**:
> "Citing whole books and articles is a disease in modern economics, spread by the author-date citation... By not bothering to find [the page] the author misses the chance to reread, and think."

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- Cite specific pages, not entire books
- Give proper credit for ideas that might otherwise seem new
- Set your paper against 2-3 closest current papers
- Don't do JEL-style comprehensive reviews
- Strategic citations may help with referees, but cut fluff in final version
- Don't abbreviate authors' names: "Fama and French" not "FF"
- Spell out people's names completely
- Author-date format citation rules: "a quotation here" (McCloskey 2000). [NOT: "a quotation here followed by close quote and period then lonely citation". (McCloskey 2000)]

---

## IV. PROCESS AND DISCIPLINE

### A. Writing as an Ongoing Process

**From Chaubey**:
> "Many people delay writing until the results are in. That is like trying to ride a bicycle one wheel at a time. Writing and research go together!"

**From McCloskey**:
> "Don't wait until the research is done to begin writing because writing, to repeat, is a way of thinking. Be writing all the time, working on a page or two here, a section there."

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- Write early rather than late
- Have notes, bits of prose ready to place in mosaic
- Use cards (4"×6") or word processor paragraphs with one idea each
- Create "The File" (C. Wright Mills): journal of systematic reflection
- Allocate notes to related stacks, look for patterns
- Add notes on transitions and new ideas
- Try different arrangements of material
- RAP outline useful for collecting feedback while still working on research
- Writing forces you to ask strictly relevant questions about facts

### B. Revision and Rewriting

**From McCloskey**:
> "Hemingway rewrote the last page of Farewell to Arms sixty times. Sixty. In pencil."

**From Dr. Johnson (quoted by McCloskey)**:
> "What is written without effort is in general read without pleasure."

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- Rewrite again and again
- Even passable writing involves multiple revisions
- Read draft a week later with cold eye
- Reread chunks of draft with pencil in hand to revise
- Check and tighten in short sessions
- Toggle typefaces to see draft in new light
- Switch media (screen to paper, typewriter to pen) to see new arrangements
- Keep finished manuscript in ringbinder for easy rereading
- At end of session, write down thoughts on what comes next (even vague notes save time warming up)
- Spellcheck everything before showing to anyone

### C. Maintaining Fluency and Spirit

**From McCloskey**:
> "Fluency can be achieved by grit... The ancient recipe for success in intellectual pursuits: locate chair; apply rear end to it; locate writing implement; use it."

**From Csikszentmihalyi (quoted by McCloskey)**:
> "Flow makes work into play and play into work... happiness occurs 'when a person's skills are fully involved in overcoming a challenge that is just about manageable.'"

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- Sneak up on subconscious resistance to filling blank pages
- Resist distractions: dishes, mail, trivial research points, social calls
- Don't let taste paralyze you—faith that more work will raise writing to new standards
- Irrational cheerfulness is good to have
- When stuck: look at outline, revise it, reread what you've written, talk to yourself, imagine explaining to friend
- Try changing surroundings, sharpening pencil, using earmuffs, playing Bach/Mozart
- Don't expect to write easily all time—writing flares and fizzles like candle
- Don't break off when on a burn
- Learn to take advantage of criticism
- We all can use more criticism—it's professional

### D. Audience Awareness

**From Cochrane**:
> "The most important thing in writing is to keep track of what your reader knows and doesn't know. Most Ph.D. students assume far too much."

**From McCloskey**:
> "Look your audience directly in the eyes. Be honest with them. Ask who they are, aim the draft toward them, and keep hauling yourself back to facing them in revisions."

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- Choose one reader and stick with her
- Don't mix audiences: pre-schooler vs. expert who knows Cobb-Douglas
- Imagine ideal economist or real person (Professor Smith, friend down the hall)
- Be haunted by people with high standards looking over shoulder
- "How would Sutch see this?"—if embarrassing, fix it
- Readers want to understand basic point before criticizing
- Most readers don't know literature or details of every paper
- Reader wants most to understand your contribution first
- Keep explaining what you've said and what you haven't

---

### E. Documentation and Reproducibility

**From Cochrane**:
> "Document your work. A fellow graduate student must be able to sit down with your paper and all alone reproduce every number in it from instructions given in the paper, and any print or web appendices."

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- Describe identification strategy clearly
- Explain how central tables were computed
- Document how standard errors were computed
- Explain how simulations were conducted
- Don't have sea of verbiage without substantive documentation
- Put enough detail that peer can reproduce all results
- But: don't go nuts with overly long captions

---

## V. EMPIRICAL WORK PRINCIPLES

### A. Identification

**From Cochrane**:
> "What are the three most important things for empirical work? Identification, Identification, Identification."

**Actionable Guidelines**:
1. Describe economic mechanism that caused dispersion in right-hand variables
2. Describe economic mechanism constituting error term
3. Explain why error term is uncorrelated with right-hand variables in economic terms
4. Explain economics of why instruments are correlated with right-hand variable and not with error term
5. Understand difference between instrument and control
6. Describe source of variation in data that drives every single number presented
7. With firm fixed effects, regression is driven by variation over time within each firm; without them, driven by variation across firms at a moment
8. Are you looking at demand curve or supply curve? Whose behavior are you modeling?
9. Does causality run from y to x, or from z to both y and x simultaneously?
10. Consider carefully what controls should and shouldn't be in regression—most papers have far too many right-hand variables

---

### B. Stylized Facts and Economic Significance

**From Cochrane**:
> "Give the stylized facts in the data that drive your result, not just estimates and p values."

**Actionable Guidelines**:
- Show expected returns of each portfolio, betas of each portfolio
- Convince readers that pattern of expected returns matches pattern of betas
- Fama-French 1996 succeeded despite disastrous GRS test because they showed stylized facts
- Explain economic significance of results, not just statistical significance
- Explain economic magnitude of central numbers
- In large panel datasets even tiniest effects are "statistically significant"
- When people show 2.10 t statistic in large panel, effect is truly tiny
- Every important number should include standard error

## VI. RULES TO LIVE BY

### Mark Twain's Seven Rules (via McCloskey):
1. Say what he is proposing to say, not merely come near it
2. Use the right word, not its second cousin
3. Eschew surplusage
4. Not omit necessary details
5. Avoid slovenliness of form
6. Use good grammar
7. Employ a simple and straightforward style

### George Orwell's Six Rules (via McCloskey):
1. Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print
2. Never use a long word where a short one will do
3. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out
4. Never use the passive where you can use the active
5. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent
6. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous

### The Meta-Rule (McCloskey):
> "Good style is above all a matter of taste... The best argument is social practice, since that is what taste is. Many people with a claim to know have listed the same rules for writing English."

## VII. COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

1. **"This paper..."** — Never start a paper this way
2. **Table-of-contents paragraphs** — "Section 2 sets out the model, section 3..."
3. **Elegant variation** — Calling same thing by different names
4. **Passive voice** — "It was found that" instead of "I found that"
5. **Nominalization** — "There is a need for reanalysis" instead of "We must reanalyze"
6. **Teutonisms** — "Private wealth-seeking activity" instead of "seeking wealth"
7. **Boilerplate** — Prefabricated, predictable prose
8. **Throat-clearing** — Starting with philosophy or policy importance
9. **Previews and recalls** — "As we will see in Table 6" or "Recall from section 2"
10. **Naked "this"** — "This shows that..." without noun after "this"
11. **Adjectives about own work** — "striking results," "very significant"
12. **"It should be noted that"** — Just say what you want to say
13. **"In other words"** — Sign you didn't say it right the first time
14. **Acronyms** — LQWAGE and BBLUUBB baffle readers
15. **Long footnotes for side trips** — If important, put in text; if not, delete
16. **Starting with literature review** — Explain your contribution first
17. **Preliminary results before main results** — Get to the point fast
18. **"Illustrative" empirical work** — Either do real work or none at all
19. **Repetition without acknowledgment** — Say things once, or say "again"
20. **Traffic signals** — Indeed, However, Furthermore, Therefore starting sentences

## VIII. FINAL WISDOM

**From McCloskey**:
> "Economics, however, is too fine a subject to be left in a verbal mess out of mere laziness. What is at first difficult becomes a pleasure in the end, like any skill of civilization, an occasion for flow."

**From Cochrane**:
> "May economists falsely think of themselves as scientists who just 'write up' research. We are not; we are primarily writers. Economics and finance papers are essays. Most good economists spend at least 50% of the time they put into any project on writing."

**From Chaubey**:
> "RAP helps researchers produce drafts that allow readers with different degrees of prior knowledge to learn as they read: RAP should go through a paper like its spine. It is what links part into a whole."

The ultimate goal: **Write so that the reader cannot possibly misunderstand.**

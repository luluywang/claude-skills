# Type A Paper Overlay: Intuitive Topic, Complex Identification

**Paper Type:** Type A - Intuitive topic requiring complex identification strategy

**Examples:** Chetty's neighborhood mobility work, EITC labor supply papers, education interventions, financial advisor misconduct (Egan, Matvos, Seru 2017)

---

## Key Characteristics

- Outcome people care about (income, education, health)
- Challenge is credible identification, not explaining what you're measuring
- Can motivate quickly ("Does neighborhood matter for kids?")
- Institutional details serve identification strategy

---

## Task Modifications for Type A Papers

### Grammar Task
**No special modifications** - Apply standard grammar rules.

---

### AI Detection Task

**Additional patterns to flag for Type A:**

**Over-explanation of intuitive concepts:**
- Explaining what education/health/income is
- Defining neighborhoods, families, outcomes that readers obviously understand
- Over-contextualizing familiar policy (EITC, Medicaid, education programs)

**Examples to flag:**
- "Education, which provides individuals with skills and knowledge..." (readers know this)
- "Neighborhoods are geographic areas where people live..." (unnecessary)
- "Income is important for well-being..." (obvious throat-clearing)

**Weak identification language when strategy is strong:**
- "Our results suggest causal effects" when you have credible natural experiment
- Over-hedging findings when identification is solid
- "This is consistent with..." when you can claim "This shows..."

---

### Structure Task

**Type A priorities:**

**Introduction:**
- Get to research design FAST (by paragraph 2-3)
- Minimize motivation (readers know why outcome matters)
- Identification strategy should be in introduction, not buried later

**Check for problems:**
- Long motivation about why topic matters (cut ruthlessly)
- Excessive institutional background before getting to natural experiment
- Research design explanation delayed until methods section

**Section ordering:**
- Identification/research design should come very early
- Institutional setting should serve identification (not standalone section)
- Data description: minimal, focus on identifying variation

**What should be prominent:**
- The natural experiment / quasi-experiment
- Source of identifying variation
- Why it's credible (exogeneity argument)

---

### Methodology Task

**Type A-specific focus:**

**Identification explanation priority:**
- This is THE contribution - must be crystal clear
- Plain English explanation required (not just equations)
- Exogeneity argument needs economic reasoning
- Source of identifying variation must be explicit

**Check for:**
- Is identification explained before showing results?
- Can reader understand identification without PhD-level econometrics?
- Is variation source concrete? ("Chicago vs. Rapid City" not "geographic heterogeneity")
- Why should we believe exclusion restriction?

**De-emphasize:**
- Lengthy institutional background (unless serves identification)
- Standard econometric details (fixed effects, clustering) - brief is fine
- Robustness to specification (summarize, put details in appendix)

**Concrete examples matter:**
- "6.5% in Chicago vs. 0.6% in Rapid City" beats abstract "substantial variation"
- Name actual places, actual policies, actual reforms
- Translate coefficients to real-world magnitudes

---

### Sentence Metrics Task
**No special modifications** - Apply standard metrics.

---

### Senior Referee Task (Type A)

**Contribution evaluation priorities for Type A:**

**Higher bar for novelty:**
- Familiar topics (labor supply, education, neighborhood effects) require genuinely surprising findings or novel identification
- Scrutinize: Is novelty claim "we confirm existing finding with new data/context"? (Insufficient for AER)
- Ask: Does new evidence change our understanding, or just replicate what we already knew?

**Contribution often in identification strategy, not question:**
- For Type A, contribution may be "first credible causal evidence" even if question is familiar
- But: Methodological innovation alone isn't enough if finding is predictable
- Assess: Does the credible identification reveal something surprising about familiar topic?

**Literature positioning critical:**
- Many Type A topics have extensive prior work
- Verify: Have authors correctly characterized what's new vs. existing estimates?
- Common problem: Ignoring field journal papers that already studied this

**Specific evaluation questions:**
- Can author state contribution in one sentence? (Should be obvious for Type A)
- Is finding surprising given existing literature, or confirmatory?
- Does identification strategy enable causal claim not previously possible?
- Would general economist care, or only specialists in sub-field?

**Desk rejection risks for Type A:**
- Incremental extension of existing causal estimates
- "First to study X in context Y" without new insight
- Confirming predictable hypothesis with new data
- Topic too narrow (e.g., specific policy in one city)

**What strengthens Type A contribution:**
- Unexpected magnitude or pattern in familiar relationship
- First credible causal evidence on important question
- Resolving debate in literature with compelling identification
- Novel measurement strategy that enables new research

---

### Junior Referee Task (Type A)

**Methods evaluation priorities for Type A:**

**Identification is THE central concern:**
- Type A contribution relies heavily on identification credibility
- Scrutinize quasi-experimental designs relentlessly
- Higher bar: Familiar topics mean readers know potential confounds

**Specific identification strategies to evaluate:**

**Difference-in-differences:**
- Parallel trends: MUST be shown (event study required, not optional)
- Treatment/control comparability: Balance tests essential
- Timing: Is treatment timing plausibly exogenous?
- Common threat: Selection into treatment correlated with trends

**IV strategies:**
- Exclusion restriction: Especially important for Type A (many potential channels)
- Example: Using knowledge as IV - does knowledge affect outcome only through behavior change?
- Demand: Explicit discussion of alternative channels and why they're ruled out

**Quasi-experiments (policy changes, discontinuities):**
- Manipulation: Are individuals/locations strategically responding?
- Spillovers: Do control units get contaminated?
- Policy endogeneity: Was policy placed where effects would be large?

**Required robustness checks for Type A:**
1. **Event studies** (for any DD or staggered adoption)
2. **Balance tests** (treatment/control comparability)
3. **Placebo tests** (falsification on outcomes that shouldn't be affected)
4. **Sensitivity to sample definition** (are results driven by specific sample restrictions?)
5. **Sensitivity to specification** (controls, functional form, winsorization)
6. **Heterogeneity analysis** (do effects vary as theory predicts?)

**Red flags specific to Type A:**
- Parallel trends assumed, not shown
- Selection into treatment not discussed
- Results highly sensitive to control variables (suggests confounding)
- Heterogeneity analysis missing (should show which populations most affected)
- Magnitudes that seem implausibly large
- All effects go in predicted direction with no null results (suggests specification search)

**Data quality concerns for Type A:**
- Measurement of familiar outcomes (earnings, education) usually good
- Watch for: Sample restrictions that select on outcome-related characteristics
- Administrative data: Usually high quality
- Survey data: Non-response and measurement error more concerning

**Assessment approach:**
- Assume contribution is important (senior's job to assess)
- Focus: Is identification strategy credible enough to support causal claims?
- Ask: What assumptions must hold? Are they plausible? What evidence supports them?
- Demand: Comprehensive robustness to rule out alternative explanations

## Type A Writing Priorities Summary

### Lead With:
- Research question (brief - readers get it)
- Identification strategy
- Preview of findings

### Spend Time On:
- Making identification credible and understandable
- Concrete examples of variation
- Economic magnitudes (not just coefficients)

### Minimize:
- Motivation (readers know why income/education/health matters)
- Institutional background (only what's needed for identification)
- Technical econometric details (summarize key points)

### Key Risk to Avoid:
- Over-explaining familiar concepts
- Losing reader in methodological details
- Delaying introduction of identification strategy

---

## Specific Language Patterns for Type A

### Flag these as problematic:

**Unnecessary motivation:**
- "Education is important for economic outcomes..." (readers know)
- "Understanding the determinants of income is central to economics..." (obvious)
- "Health affects quality of life..." (throat-clearing)

**Technical jargon for familiar concepts:**
- "Human capital accumulation" → "kids' later earnings"
- "Labor force participation decisions" → "whether people work"
- "Residential location choices" → "where families live"

**Weak claims when identification is strong:**
- "Results suggest" → "Results show" (if identification is credible)
- "Consistent with the hypothesis that" → Direct statement (if that's what you find)
- "Evidence indicates" → "We find" (if evidence is strong)

### Encourage these patterns:

**Concrete examples:**
- "Moving from the 25th to 75th percentile neighborhood increases income by 12%"
- "In Chicago, 6.5% of EITC claimants bunch; in Rapid City, only 0.6% do"
- Specific places, specific numbers, specific magnitudes

**Plain language identification:**
- "Our strategy is simple: compare cities that differ in X but are otherwise similar"
- "The key insight is that..."
- "We exploit the fact that..."

**Direct causal claims (when warranted):**
- "We find that X causes Y"
- "The effect of X on Y is..."
- "X increases Y by..."

## Examples from Type A Papers

### Good Type A opening (EITC paper):
> "We estimate the impacts of the Earned Income Tax Credit on labor supply using local variation in knowledge about the EITC schedule. We proxy for EITC knowledge in a ZIP code with the fraction of individuals who manipulate reported self-employment income to maximize their EITC refund."

**Why it works:**
- No throat-clearing about why EITC or labor supply matters
- Jumps straight to identification strategy
- Concrete measure of knowledge (manipulation behavior)
- Readers immediately understand the contribution

### Good Type A opening (Financial Advisor Misconduct):
> "American households rely on financial advisers for financial planning and transaction services. Over 650,000 registered financial advisers in the United States help manage over $30 trillion of investible assets, and represent approximately 10% of total employment of the finance and insurance sector."

**Why it works:**
- Concrete scale immediately: "650,000 advisers", "$30 trillion"
- No philosophy about why trust matters
- First sentence is simple context, second is scale
- Gets to findings in abstract: "7% have misconduct, 15% at largest firms"

### Type A identification explanation:
> "Our research design is based on a simple idea: individuals with no knowledge of a tax policy's marginal incentives behave as they would in the absence of the policy. Hence, we can identify the causal effect of a policy by comparing behavior across cities that differ in knowledge about the policy but are otherwise comparable."

**Why it works:**
- Plain English (no jargon)
- "Simple idea" framing (not "sophisticated strategy")
- Logic is transparent
- Any reader can understand the exogeneity argument

## Red Flags for Type A Papers

- [ ] Introduction spends > 1 page on motivation
- [ ] Topic importance explained extensively
- [ ] Institutional details before research question
- [ ] Identification strategy not in introduction
- [ ] Technical jargon for familiar outcomes
- [ ] Over-hedging when identification is credible
- [ ] Coefficients reported without translation to magnitudes
- [ ] Abstract "heterogeneity" instead of concrete examples

If these patterns appear, they should be flagged and revised.

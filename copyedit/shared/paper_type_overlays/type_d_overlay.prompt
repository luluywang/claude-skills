# Type D Paper Overlay: Theory Applied to Data

**Paper Type:** Type D - Theory paper with empirical testing

**Examples:** Testing theoretical predictions, structural estimation, banking runs (Egan, Hortaçsu, Matvos 2015), growth empirics (Mankiw, Romer, Weil 1992)

---

## Key Characteristics

- Theory generates testable predictions
- Empirics assess which theory fits
- Challenge is keeping theory tractable while realistic enough to test
- Need to map theory to observables clearly

---

## Task Modifications for Type D Papers

### AI Detection Task

**Additional patterns to flag:**

**Abstract theory motivation:**
- Starting with general theoretical framework
- "Consider an economy with..." before empirical puzzle
- Theory for theory's sake

**Weak theory-data connection:**
- "The model fits the data well" (what does that mean?)
- Unclear mapping from theory variables to observables
- Predictions that are obvious or unfalsifiable

**Over-theoretical language:**
- Excessive formalism when plain language would work
- Hiding empirical findings in theoretical complexity
- "Theoretical considerations suggest..." when evidence is available

---

### Structure Task

**Type D priorities:**

**Introduction structure:**
1. Empirical puzzle or question
2. Competing theories (brief)
3. Your approach (theory + testable predictions)
4. What you find empirically

**NOT:**
1. Abstract theory
2. General framework
3. Eventually: "We test this empirically"

**Section ordering:**
- Section 1: Intro (puzzle-driven)
- Section 2: Stylized facts motivating theory
- Section 3: Model (simplest version that works)
- Section 4: Testable predictions
- Section 5: Empirical tests
- Section 6: Alternative explanations

**Check for problems:**
- Theory section before empirical motivation
- General model then specialized (reverse it)
- No stylized facts shown
- Predictions unclear or unfalsifiable
- Empirical results buried in theory

---

### Methodology Task

**Type D-specific focus:**

**Theory-data mapping:**
- Must be crystal clear
- Theory variable X maps to observable Y how?
- Which prediction distinguishes this theory from alternatives?
- Can reader see the connection?

**Model presentation:**
- Simplest model that delivers testable predictions
- NOT most general version
- Economic interpretation throughout
- Avoid "for generality, assume..." then specialize

**Empirical testing:**
- Stylized facts should be prominent
- Not just "model fits" - show patterns in data
- Economic interpretation of results
- Can tests distinguish between theories?

**Check for:**
- Is model motivated by empirical puzzle?
- Can reader map theory to data?
- Are predictions testable and non-obvious?
- Do tests distinguish between competing theories?
- Are empirical findings emphasized?

---

### Senior Referee Task (Type D)

**Contribution evaluation priorities for Type D:**

**Theory must provide non-trivial insight:**
- Scrutinize: Does theory formalize the obvious, or generate genuine insight?
- Ask: Could we have predicted the empirical findings without the formal model?
- Watch for: "Formalizing conventional wisdom" presented as theoretical contribution

**Key contribution questions:**
- What does the theory teach us that we couldn't have known from intuition?
- Does model generate surprising predictions that are then validated?
- Does theory rule out alternative explanations or mechanisms?
- Is formal model necessary, or could simple framework deliver same insights?

**Theory-empirics integration:**
- Best Type D papers: Theory and empirics are both important and integrated
- Watch for imbalance: "90% theory, 10% cursory empirical validation" or vice versa
- Assess: Do empirical findings inform theory? Does theory organize empirical patterns?

**Novelty assessment:**
- Theoretical novelty: New mechanism, new predictions, or extension of known model?
- Empirical novelty: New evidence, new patterns in data?
- Ideally both, but at minimum one must be strong

**Specific evaluation questions:**
- Does theory generate testable, non-obvious predictions?
- Do empirical tests genuinely distinguish between theories?
- Is model tractable enough that predictions are interpretable?
- Would paper be publishable on theory alone? On empirics alone? (At least one should be yes)

**Desk rejection risks for Type D:**
- Theory that simply formalizes obvious intuition
- Model generates predictable hypotheses with no surprises
- Empirical validation is cursory (just confirming model matches data by construction)
- Theory and empirics feel disconnected (theory not actually needed for empirics)
- Both theory and empirics are incremental (neither stands alone)

**What strengthens Type D contribution:**
- Model generates counter-intuitive predictions that turn out to be true
- Theory organizes disparate empirical facts under unified framework
- Model clarifies mechanisms and rules out alternatives
- Quantitative predictions calibrated and validated
- Both theory and empirics make substantive contributions

**Presentation assessment:**
- Is empirical motivation clear upfront?
- Can reader understand model's economic intuition?
- Is connection between theory and data transparent?

### Junior Referee Task (Type D)

**Methods evaluation priorities for Type D:**

**Structural estimation and calibration scrutiny:**
- Type D often involves calibration or structural estimation
- Scrutinize: What's identified from data vs. imposed from literature/assumptions?
- Watch for: Parameters chosen to make model fit, not estimated

**Theory validation requirements:**

**Theoretical foundations:**
- Are assumptions stated clearly and economically motivated?
- Are equilibria characterized rigorously?
- Are proofs provided or sketched?
- Could results change under alternative (reasonable) assumptions?

**Identification in structural models:**
- Which parameters are identified? From what variation?
- Are overidentifying restrictions tested?
- Sensitivity to functional form assumptions?
- Could different model specifications generate same patterns?

**Calibration assessment:**
- Which parameters calibrated (externally imposed)?
- Are calibrated values well-justified from literature/data?
- Are key results sensitive to calibrated parameters?
- Is calibration transparent (not tuned to fit)?

**Model validation:**
- Are model predictions tested out-of-sample?
- Does model fit facts NOT targeted in calibration?
- Are alternative models compared?
- What can model NOT explain? (Honest assessment of limitations)

**Empirical testing of predictions:**
- Are tests genuinely testing theory, or confirming by construction?
- Could alternative theories generate same patterns?
- Are tests robust to specification choices?
- Statistical inference appropriate?

**Required robustness checks for Type D:**
1. **Parameter sensitivity**: Key results robust to parameter values?
2. **Functional form**: Results depend on specific functional forms?
3. **Alternative mechanisms**: Can competing models be ruled out?
4. **Moment targeting**: Results hold for non-targeted moments?
5. **Quantitative predictions**: Magnitudes reasonable, not just signs?

**Red flags specific to Type D:**
- Parameters calibrated to make model fit, not estimated
- No sensitivity analysis on calibrated parameters
- Model fits targeted moments well but fails on non-targeted moments
- Overidentifying restrictions not tested (or fail but not reported)
- "Illustrative" quantitative exercise without real data
- Alternative models not considered
- Theory generates obvious predictions presented as insights
- Empirical tests don't actually distinguish between theories

**Theory-specific assessment:**
- Are knife-edge assumptions driving results?
- Could simpler model deliver same predictions?
- Is model tractable enough for economic intuition?

**Assessment approach:**
- Assume theoretical contribution is important if novel (senior's job)
- Focus: Does theory work as claimed? Are empirical tests credible?
- Ask: Do I believe parameter choices? Are results robust?
- Demand: Clear separation of what's identified vs. imposed, transparent sensitivity analysis

## Specific Language Patterns for Type D

### Flag these:

**Abstract theory opening:**
- "Consider an economy with agents who maximize..."
- "In a general framework with..."
- Theory before empirical puzzle

**Weak theory-data language:**
- "The model fits the data"
- "Consistent with theory"
- "As predicted by the model"
- No clear mapping explained

**Over-generality:**
- "For generality, we consider..." then specialize
- "Without loss of generality, assume..."
- Most general model when specific version is clearer

**Vague predictions:**
- Predictions that are obvious
- Predictions that can't be falsified
- Predictions that don't distinguish between theories

### Encourage these:

**Empirical puzzle opening:**
- "Television outlets whose viewers watch more TV charge lower ad prices. Why?"
- "We observe pattern X in the data. Competing theories predict..."
- Puzzle or pattern before theory

**Clear mapping:**
- "We measure theory variable θ using observable X"
- "The model's prediction about Y maps to testing whether..."
- Explicit connection between theory and empirics

**Specific predictions:**
- "Theory A predicts X should increase with Y; Theory B predicts no relationship"
- Testable, non-obvious, distinguishes theories
- "The key distinction is that only our model predicts..."

**Empirical emphasis:**
- Stylized facts prominent
- "Figure X shows the pattern predicted by the model"
- Economic interpretation of fit

## Examples from Type D Papers

### Good Type D opening (advertising pricing):
> "Existing theories of media competition imply that advertisers will pay a lower price in equilibrium to reach consumers who multi-home across competing outlets. We generalize, extend, and test this prediction. We find that television outlets whose viewers watch more television charge a lower price per impression to advertisers."

**Why it works:**
- Theory prediction stated (not derived from scratch)
- Empirical test immediately
- Finding in concrete terms
- Theory serves empirics, not vice versa

### Good Type D opening (Banking Runs):
> "Figure 1 suggests that financial distress of banks affects their ability to attract uninsured deposits. We plot the relationship between the uninsured deposit market shares and financial distress for Citi Bank and JPMorgan Chase from 2005 through 2010. As distress of Citi Bank increases relative to JPMorgan, Citi's market share of uninsured deposits decreases and JPMorgan's market share increases (Panel A). Note that the market shares of insured deposits, which should be insensitive to distress, show no such relationship (Panel B)."

**Why it works:**
- Leads with stylized fact (Figure 1) before theory
- Concrete example: Citi vs. JPMorgan (not "banks in distress")
- Natural comparison: insured vs. uninsured deposits
- Empirical puzzle motivates theoretical model
- Shows pattern in data, not just claims it exists

## Red Flags for Type D Papers

- [ ] Abstract theory motivation before empirical puzzle
- [ ] General model then specialized (should reverse)
- [ ] No stylized facts shown prominently
- [ ] Unclear theory-to-data mapping
- [ ] Predictions obvious or unfalsifiable
- [ ] Tests can't distinguish between theories
- [ ] "Model fits" without showing patterns
- [ ] Empirical findings buried in theoretical complexity
- [ ] Theory for theory's sake (if not expanding theory knowledge)

If these patterns appear, they should be flagged and revised.

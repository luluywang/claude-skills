# Task: Structure Analysis

**Purpose:** High-level review of paper organization and transitions. Not line-by-line editing.

**Output:** `notes/structure_analysis.md`

---

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Introduction Structure

**Check for:**
- Inverted pyramid (punchline first)?
- RAP clear (Research question, Answer, Positioning)?
- Literature AFTER contribution (not before)?
- Length ≤ 3 pages?

**Common problems:**
- Throat-clearing, policy importance before contribution
- Literature review first
- Excessive roadmap paragraphs
- "This paper..." openings

**Paper type considerations:**
- Type A: Gets to identification fast
- Type B: Explains institutions before deep dive
- Type C: Economic question before method details
- Type D: Empirical puzzle before theory

### 2. Body Section Structure

**Two goals for each body section:**

1. **Connect to RAP Narrative**
   - Opening links to central question/answer using key words from intro
   - Explains WHY this section matters for the overall argument
   - Reader shouldn't feel lost or wonder "why are we doing this?"
   - Good: "Having established X, we now examine the mechanism..."
   - Bad: Jumping into details without context

2. **Clearly Explain What Is Done**
   - State what the section will show BEFORE showing it
   - Preview findings, then present evidence
   - Good: "We find effect is concentrated in X. Table 3 confirms..."
   - Bad: "Table 3 shows the results" (results of what?)

**Common problems:**
- Diving into details without connecting to story
- Section openers that describe methods without explaining purpose
- Missing bridge between "what we're doing" and "why it matters"

### 3. Section Ordering

**Check for:**
- Logical progression
- Main results early (not Table 12)
- Robustness in appendix (not cluttering main paper)

**Common problems:**
- Long descriptive stats before main analysis
- General model → specialization (should reverse)

### 4. Transitions

**Good:** Carry forward key concept, answer provoked question

**Bad:** "Moreover," "Additionally" at every paragraph start, mechanical signposts

### 5. Headings

**Good:** Declarative, specific ("Securitization Reduces Screening by 25%")

**Bad:** Generic ("Model", "Data", "Results")

### 6. Conclusion

- Necessary or redundant?
- Short (1 page max)?
- Adds insight or just repeats?

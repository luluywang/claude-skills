# Task: Structure Analysis

**Purpose:** High-level review of paper organization and transitions. Not line-by-line editing.

**Output:** `notes/structure_analysis.md`

---

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Introduction Structure

**Check for:**
- Inverted pyramid (punchline first)?
- RAP clear (Research question, Answer, Positioning)?
- Literature AFTER contribution (not before)?
- Length ≤ 3 pages?

**Common problems:**
- Throat-clearing, policy importance before contribution
- Literature review first
- Excessive roadmap paragraphs
- "This paper..." openings

**Paper type considerations:**
- Type A: Gets to identification fast
- Type B: Explains institutions before deep dive
- Type C: Economic question before method details
- Type D: Empirical puzzle before theory

### 2. Section Ordering

**Check for:**
- Logical progression
- Main results early (not Table 12)
- Robustness in appendix (not cluttering main paper)

**Common problems:**
- Long descriptive stats before main analysis
- General model → specialization (should reverse)

### 3. Transitions

**Good:** Carry forward key concept, answer provoked question

**Bad:** "Moreover," "Additionally" at every paragraph start, mechanical signposts

### 4. Headings

**Good:** Declarative, specific ("Securitization Reduces Screening by 25%")

**Bad:** Generic ("Model", "Data", "Results")

### 5. Conclusion

- Necessary or redundant?
- Short (1 page max)?
- Adds insight or just repeats?

# Task: Flow Extraction

**Purpose:** Extract and display the paper's argumentative skeleton so the writer can see if the flow works. Then analyze for gaps.

**Output:** `notes/flow_extraction.md`

---

## Step 1: Extract Section Skeleton

For each section and subsection, extract:
- The heading
- The first paragraph (the "takeaway" that should orient readers)

Display them in document order with clear hierarchy.

---

## Step 2: Extract Paragraph Skeleton

Extract the first sentence of every paragraph in the paper, in order.

Display as a numbered list so the writer can read them as a continuous narrative.

---

## Step 3: Analyze

### Section Openers

**For Introduction:**
- Establishes RAP (Research question, Answer, Positioning)?
- Sets up what's coming in the paper?
- Contribution first (inverted pyramid)?

**For Body Sections:**
- **Connects to RAP** — Uses key words from intro, links to central question?
- **States purpose** — Why this section matters for the argument?
- **Previews content** — What the section will show?
- **Prepares for details** — Orients reader before diving in?

Flag sections that fail either the RAP connection or the purpose statement.

### First Sentences

For the paragraph skeleton, check:
1. **Coherent story** — Can you follow the argument reading only first sentences?
2. **Key word chains** — Do first sentences carry forward phrases from previous ones?
3. **Main messages** — Does each first sentence state an idea (not just a detail)?
4. **Forward momentum** — Does each provoke a question the paragraph answers?

Identify breaks in the chain where flow is lost.

## Analysis

### Section Opener Issues

| Section | Issue |
|---------|-------|
| [Section name] | [What's missing: main message / link to story / preparation / provocation] |

### Flow Breaks in Paragraph Skeleton

| After sentence # | Issue |
|------------------|-------|
| [#] | [What breaks: topic shift without link / missing key word chain / detail instead of idea] |

### Summary

**Strengths:** [What's working in the flow]

**Priority fixes:**
1. [Most important flow issue]
2. [Second]
3. [Third]

# Task: Methodology Clarity Review

**Purpose:** Assess whether identification strategy and methods are explained clearly for the paper's audience and type.

**Output:** `notes/methodology_review.md`

---

## Analysis by Paper Type

### Type A (Intuitive Topic, Complex Identification)

**Check:**
- Identification explained in plain English first?
- What variation identifies estimates?
- Why is error term uncorrelated with X?
- Instrument exclusion clearly justified?

**Common problems:**
- Jumps to equation without intuition
- Doesn't explain WHAT variation identifies
- Too many controls without justification

### Type B (Specialized Topic)

**Check:**
- Institutions explained before assuming knowledge?
- Concrete language, not just jargon?
- One detail at a time?
- Institutions connected to economic mechanism?

**Common problems:**
- Assumes reader knows specialized market
- Front-loads institutional details before question
- Jargon without definition

### Type C (Methodological Innovation)

**Check:**
- Economic question stated first?
- Why existing methods fail?
- Intuition before math?
- Simple example provided?

**Common problems:**
- Leads with technique before question
- Excessive generality ("consider general process...")
- "Illustrative" application (half-hearted empirics)

### Type D (Theory + Data)

**Check:**
- Motivated by empirical puzzle?
- Simplest model that delivers predictions?
- Clear mapping: theory variables → observables?
- Can distinguish between theories?

**Common problems:**
- Abstract theory motivation
- General model then specialized (should reverse)
- Can't distinguish between competing explanations

---

## Specification Clarity

**Check:**
- Variables defined before equation?
- Standard errors method stated (clustered how?)?
- Sample restrictions clear?
- Fixed effects explicitly noted?

---

## Audience Level

**Over-explaining:** Explaining what fixed effects control for, spelling out "IV diff-in-diff"

**Under-explaining:** Assuming specialized institutional knowledge

**Hedging:** "suggests" when identification is credible

# Task: Grammar & Mechanics Review

**Model:** Haiku (adversarial multi-pass iterations)

**Purpose:** Identify and fix ALL objective errors through adversarial iteration.

**Output:**
- Corrected .tex files
- `notes/copy_edits.md` documenting all changes across passes

**Output Mode:** APPEND — do not overwrite existing content

**Section Format:** Start each file's corrections with `## [filename.tex]`

## CRITICAL: Objective Errors Only — Auto-Fix These

This task AUTO-FIXES errors directly in .tex files. Only fix errors that are **objectively wrong** — a competent editor would agree it's an error.

### ✓ FIX IN-LINE (objective errors)
- Spelling mistakes, typos
- Homophones used incorrectly (their/there, its/it's)
- Subject-verb disagreement
- Comma splices, run-ons, fragments
- Incorrect punctuation
- Formatting inconsistencies

### ✗ DO NOT FIX — Send to `simplifications.md` instead
- Wordiness ("due to the fact that" → "because")
- Weak word choice ("utilize" → "use")
- Passive voice where active is better
- Awkward but grammatically correct sentences
- Sentence rhythm/length issues
- AI-typical phrasing

**Rule of thumb:** If it's a style preference rather than a clear error, it goes to `simplifications.md` as a suggestion, not an in-line fix.

## Error Categories

### Spelling & Homophones
- Typos, misspellings
- Homophones: tough/through, affect/effect, their/there/they're, its/it's, whose/who's
- Confused words: ensure/insure, fewer/less, imply/infer

### Grammar
- Subject-verb agreement: "data show" (data is plural)
- Pronoun agreement: "firm must consider its options"
- Verb tense inconsistencies
- Sentence fragments, run-ons, comma splices
- Dangling modifiers
- Article errors: "an unique" → "a unique"
- Prepositions: "Different from" not "Different than"

### Punctuation
- Comma placement (introductory phrases, lists, clauses)
- Apostrophes: it's = it is, its = possessive
- Hyphenation: "short-run equilibrium" (before noun), "in the short run" (after)
- Exception: adverbs with -ly don't need hyphens

### Formatting & Consistency
- Capitalization: Table 1 vs table 2
- Numbers: consistent numerals vs words
- Abbreviations: U.S. vs US (pick one)
- Citation formatting

### LaTeX-Specific
- Syntax errors breaking compilation
- Math mode delimiters
- Missing/extra braces
- DO NOT flag: `---` (correct em-dash), spacing commands

## Adversarial Multi-Pass Workflow

### Pass 1: Initial Review (Haiku)

1. Read each file carefully
2. Identify and fix ALL errors you can find
3. Apply corrections with Edit tool
4. Document in `notes/copy_edits.md` with header `## Pass 1`

### Pass 2+: Adversarial Review (Haiku)

Launch another Haiku agent with this adversarial prompt:

```
You are reviewing a document that has already been copyedited, but errors were MISSED.
Your job is to find the errors that the previous reviewer overlooked.

The previous reviewer was good but not perfect. There are almost certainly:
- Subtle homophones they missed (its/it's, affect/effect, their/there)
- Subject-verb agreement errors in complex sentences
- Inconsistent formatting (Table 1 vs table 2, U.S. vs US)
- Missing or misplaced commas
- Hyphenation errors

Read the document with fresh eyes. Be skeptical. Check every sentence.
Previous corrections are logged in notes/copy_edits.md - don't re-flag those.

Report ONLY newly found errors. If you find none after careful review, report "No additional errors found."
```

### Iteration Loop

1. Run Haiku adversarial pass
2. If new errors found:
   - Apply fixes
   - Append to `copy_edits.md` with header `## Pass N (Haiku)`
   - Go to step 1
3. If no new errors found:
   - Stop iteration
   - Report total errors fixed across all passes

## Output Format

`notes/copy_edits.md` structure:

```markdown
# Grammar & Mechanics Corrections

## Pass 1
- file.tex:42 → "their" → "there"
- file.tex:87 → "effect" → "affect"
...

## Pass 2
- file.tex:103 → "data is" → "data are"
...

## Pass 3
No additional errors found. Review complete.

---
**Total: X errors corrected across Y passes**
```

---

## Quality Control

- [ ] Every correction is objective error, not stylistic
- [ ] All .tex files syntactically valid
- [ ] Changes documented in copy_edits.md with pass numbers
- [ ] Iteration continued until no new errors found

# Task: Writing Quality Assessment

**Purpose:** Assess whether each paragraph achieves its purpose — focused, mechanistic, precise, and terse. This is the middle layer between surface corrections (grammar, word choice) and macro structure (organization, flow).

**Model:** Sonnet (requires deep judgment about argument quality)

**Output:** `notes/writing_quality.md`

**Output Mode:** APPEND — do not overwrite existing content

**Reference:** Read `references/writing_quality_standards.md` before analyzing. It codifies the author's 14 principles and 9 LLM-vs-Human contrasts.

## Section Format

When analyzing a file, append:

```markdown
## [filename.tex]

### Section: [section name]

[Assessment and checklist items organized by section]

## The 8 Dimensions

Assess each paragraph against these dimensions. Not every dimension applies to every paragraph — flag only genuine issues.

### 1. Paragraph Focus (Principle #4)

**Check:** Does the paragraph make exactly one point?

**Flags:**
- Paragraph introduces a concept, reports results, explains mechanism, AND draws implications
- Topic sentence absent or buried
- Paragraph exceeds ~8 sentences without a clear single argument

### 2. Mechanism Clarity (Principle #2, Contrast II.3)

**Check:** Does the paragraph explain *why*, not just *what*?

**Flags:**
- Numerical comparison stated without causal explanation
- Results reported without tracing the economic channel
- "Because" or "since" absent after any result

### 3. Number Integration (Principle #7, Contrast II.6)

**Check:** Does every number answer "so what?" and serve as evidence?

**Flags:**
- Inventory-style sequences: "X changed by A, Y changed by B, Z changed by C"
- Numbers presented as a list rather than embedded as evidence for claims
- Number in prose that would be better in a table

### 4. Motivation & Tension (Principle #5, Contrast II.1)

**Check:** Does the reader know *why* before *what*?

**Flags:**
- Section opens by announcing its result rather than the puzzle
- No tension, surprise, or question motivating the analysis
- Reader is told what to think before seeing the evidence

### 5. Math Precision (Principle #3)

**Check:** Are mathematical claims exact, not hand-waved?

**Flags:**
- Prose paraphrases a formula that should be displayed
- "This moment identifies the parameter because..." instead of showing the moment condition
- Vague identification arguments without explicit equations
- "Approximately" or "roughly" used where exact values are available

### 6. Intellectual Precision (Principles #11, #12)

**Check:** Are results, assumptions, and calibration targets labeled correctly? Does the framing match the method?

**Flags:**
- Estimated result described as an assumption (or vice versa)
- Joint estimation described as sequential steps
- Two distinct mechanisms conflated into one summary
- Calibrated parameter described as estimated
- Causal language when identification is only correlational

### 7. Economy (Principles #8, #9, #13, Contrast II.5)

**Check:** Is the prose free of throat-clearing, lecturing, and unnecessary complexity?

**Flags:**
- "This section analyzes..." / "Below we show..." / "The following demonstrates..."
- Explaining what fixed effects do, what IV means, or other basics to field experts
- Elaborate indirect language where a direct statement would do
- Meta-commentary about the paper's structure
- Transition words as sentence openers ("Moreover," "Additionally," "Furthermore")

### 8. Limitations Handling (Principle #6, Contrasts II.7, II.8)

**Check:** Are limitations named plainly? Are minor caveats in footnotes, not inline?

**Flags:**
- "May not fully capture" / "unlikely to be sufficient" (reflexive softening)
- Limitations buried in hedge-laden qualifications
- Minor caveats cluttering the main argument instead of footnotes
- Limitations omitted entirely when they should be acknowledged

## Priority Ordering

When multiple issues overlap in the same paragraph, prioritize in this order:

1. **Intellectual precision** — wrong characterization of results/assumptions
2. **Missing mechanism** — *what* without *why*
3. **False structure** — sequential framing of joint estimation, conflated mechanisms
4. **Unfocused paragraph** — doing too much
5. **Hand-waved math** — prose where formulas should be
6. **Inventorial numbers** — list of numbers not serving as evidence
7. **Missing motivation** — no tension before result
8. **Throat-clearing** — meta-commentary, lecturing, over-explanation

Flag the highest-priority issue; mention lower-priority issues briefly if present.

## Output Format (Checklist)

**CRITICAL:** Original and Proposed Revision must show COMPLETE SENTENCES — never truncate mid-sentence. This enables batch application via `apply_marked.prompt`.

```markdown
### - [ ] Lines X-Y: [Brief description]

**Dimension:** [Which of the 8 dimensions]

**Comment:** [Why this paragraph falls short]

**Original:**
```
[Full sentence(s) containing the issue — never fragments]
```

**Proposed Revision:**
```
[Complete revised sentence(s)]
```

**Why better:** [Concrete improvement linked to specific principle]
```

## Optional: Section Grading

When the user requests grading (e.g., `/copyedit quality --grade`), provide a letter grade per section:

| Grade | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| A | Paragraphs focused, mechanisms clear, math exact, no padding |
| A- | Minor economy issues, one paragraph slightly overloaded |
| B+ | Some inventorial numbers or missing motivation |
| B | Multiple unfocused paragraphs or hand-waved math |
| B- | Significant missing mechanisms or intellectual imprecision |
| C+ | Systematic throat-clearing or false structural framing |
| C | Fundamental issues: wrong characterization of results, missing causal logic |

Grade summary format:

```markdown
## Section Grades

| Section | Grade | Primary Issue |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| Introduction | A- | Minor throat-clearing in opening |
| Model | B+ | Two paragraphs overloaded |
| Estimation | B | Identification hand-waved in prose |
| Results | A | Clean, mechanistic, terse |
| Counterfactuals | B- | Inventorial numbers, missing mechanisms |
```

## Relationship to Other Tasks

- **ai_detection** (Haiku): Quickly flags surface LLM patterns (punctuation, vocabulary, transitions). Part C flags rhetorical patterns but defers definitive paragraph-level judgment here.
- **writing_quality** (Sonnet): Makes the deep judgment call — is the paragraph genuinely good writing? Uses the author's standards, not just LLM pattern matching.
- **word_choice**: Handles individual word substitutions (Anglo-Saxon over Latin, weak verbs). Writing_quality handles paragraph-level quality.
- **sentence_analysis**: Handles sentence rhythm and S-V-O structure. Writing_quality handles whether the paragraph's argument is sound.

If `ai_detection` flags a pattern that `writing_quality` also addresses, `writing_quality` takes precedence in wrapup deduplication.

## Quality Control

- [ ] `writing_quality.md`: Assessment appended (not overwritten)
- [ ] Section header `## [filename.tex]` present
- [ ] Every flagged item has Dimension, Comment, Original, Proposed, Why better
- [ ] Priority ordering respected: intellectual precision > mechanism > structure > focus
- [ ] Proposed revisions are actionable rewrites, not vague advice
- [ ] Math precision flags include what formula should replace the prose
- [ ] No overlap with word_choice (individual word issues) or sentence_analysis (rhythm)
- [ ] `references/writing_quality_standards.md` was read before analysis

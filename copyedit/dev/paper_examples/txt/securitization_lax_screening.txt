A central question surrounding the current subprime crisis is whether the securitization process reduced the incentives of financial intermediaries to carefully
screen borrowers. We examine this issue empirically using data on securitized
subprime mortgage loan contracts in the United States. We exploit a specific rule
of thumb in the lending market to generate exogenous variation in the ease of
securitization and compare the composition and performance of lenders’ portfolios
around the ad hoc threshold. Conditional on being securitized, the portfolio with
greater ease of securitization defaults by around 10%–25% more than a similar
risk profile group with a lesser ease of securitization. We conduct additional analyses to rule out differential selection by market participants around the threshold
and lenders employing an optimal screening cutoff unrelated to securitization as
alternative explanations. The results are confined to loans where intermediaries’
screening effort may be relevant and soft information about borrowers determines
their creditworthiness. Our findings suggest that existing securitization practices
did adversely affect the screening incentives of subprime lenders.

DID SECURITIZATION LEAD TO LAX SCREENING?
EVIDENCE FROM SUBPRIME LOANS∗

QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

option to sell loans to investors has transformed the traditional
role of financial intermediaries in the mortgage market from “buying and holding” to “buying and selling.” The perceived benefits
of this financial innovation, such as improving risk sharing and
reducing banks’ cost of capital, are widely cited (e.g., Pennacchi
[1988]). However, delinquencies in the heavily securitized subprime housing market increased by 50% from 2005 to 2007, forcing
many mortgage lenders out of business and setting off a wave of financial crises, which spread worldwide. In light of the central role
of the subprime mortgage market in the current crisis, critiques
of the securitization process have gained increased prominence
(Blinder 2007; Stiglitz 2007).
The rationale for concern over the “originate-to-distribute”
model during the crisis derives from theories of financial intermediation. Delegating monitoring to a single lender avoids the
duplication, coordination failure, and free-rider problems associated with multiple lenders (Diamond 1984). However, for a lender
to screen and monitor, it must be given appropriate incentives
(Hölmstrom and Tirole 1997), and this is provided by the illiquid
loans on its balance sheet (Diamond and Rajan 2003). By creating
distance between a loan’s originator and the bearer of the loan’s
default risk, securitization may have potentially reduced lenders’
incentives to carefully screen and monitor borrowers (Petersen
and Rajan 2002). On the other hand, proponents of securitization
argue that reputation concerns, regulatory oversight, or sufficient
balance sheet risk may have prevented moral hazard on the part
of lenders. What the effects of existing securitization practices on
screening were thus remains an empirical question.
This paper investigates the relationship between securitization and screening standards in the context of subprime mortgage
loans. The challenge in making a causal claim is the difficulty of
isolating differences in loan outcomes independent of contract and
borrower characteristics. First, in any cross section of loans, those
that are securitized may differ on observable and unobservable
risk characteristics from loans that are kept on the balance sheet
(not securitized). Second, in a time-series framework, simply documenting a correlation between securitization rates and defaults
may be insufficient. This inference relies on establishing the optimal level of defaults at any given point in time. Moreover, this approach ignores macroeconomic factors and policy initiatives that
may be independent of lax screening and yet may induce compositional differences in mortgage borrowers over time. For instance,

house price appreciation and the changing role of governmentsponsored enterprises (GSEs) in the subprime market may also
have accelerated the trend toward originating mortgages to riskier
borrowers in exchange for higher payments.
We overcome these challenges by exploiting a specific rule of
thumb in the lending market that induces exogenous variation in
the ease of securitization of a loan compared to another loan with
similar observable characteristics. This rule of thumb is based
on the summary measure of borrower credit quality known as
the FICO score. Since the mid-1990s, the FICO score has become
the credit indicator most widely used by lenders, rating agencies, and investors. Underwriting guidelines established by the
GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, standardized purchases of
lenders’ mortgage loans. These guidelines cautioned against lending to risky borrowers, the most prominent rule of thumb being
not lending to borrowers with FICO scores below 620 (Avery et al.
1996; Loesch 1996; Calomiris and Mason 1999; Freddie Mac 2001,
2007; Capone 2002).1 Whereas the GSEs actively securitized loans
when the nascent subprime market was relatively small, since
2000 this role has shifted entirely to investment banks and hedge
funds (the nonagency sector). We argue that persistent adherence
to this ad hoc cutoff by investors who purchase securitized pools
from nonagencies generates a differential increase in the ease of
securitization for loans. That is, loans made to borrowers which
fall just above the 620 credit cutoff have a higher unconditional
likelihood of being securitized and are therefore more liquid than
loans below this cutoff.
To evaluate the effect of securitization on screening decisions,
we examine the performance of loans originated by lenders around
this threshold. As an example of our design, consider two borrowers, one with a FICO score of 621 (620+ ) and the other with a
FICO score of 619 (620− ), who approach the lender for a loan.
Screening to evaluate the quality of the loan applicant involves
collecting both “hard” information, such as the credit score, and
“soft” information, such as a measure of future income stability of
the borrower. Hard information, by definition, is something that
is easy to contract upon (and transmit), whereas the lender has
to exert an unobservable effort to collect soft information (Stein
2002). We argue that the lender has a weaker incentive to base
1. We discuss the 620 rule of thumb in more detail in Section III and in
reference to other cutoffs in the lending market in Section IV.G.

origination decisions on both hard and soft information, less carefully screening the borrower, at 620+ , where there is an increase
in the relative ease of securitization. In other words, because investors purchase securitized loans based on hard information, the
cost of collecting soft information is internalized by lenders when
screening borrowers at 620+ to a lesser extent than at 620− . Therefore, by comparing the portfolio of loans on either side of the credit
score threshold, we can assess whether differential access to securitization led to changes in the behavior of lenders who offered
these loans to consumers with nearly identical risk profiles.
Using a sample of more than one million home purchase
loans during the period 2001–2006, we empirically confirm that
the number of loans securitized varies systematically around the
620 FICO cutoff. For loans with a potential for significant soft
information—low documentation loans—we find that there are
more than twice as many loans securitized above the credit threshold at 620+ than below the threshold at 620− . Because the FICO
score distribution in the population is smooth (constructed from
a logistic function; see Figure I), the underlying creditworthiness
and demand for mortgage loans (at a given price) are the same
for prospective buyers with a credit score of either 620− or 620+ .
Therefore, these differences in the number of loans confirm that
the unconditional probability of securitization is higher above the
FICO threshold; that is, it is easier to securitize 620+ loans.
Strikingly, we find that although 620+ loans should be of
slightly better credit quality than those at 620− , lowdocumentation loans that are originated above the credit
threshold tend to default within two years of origination at a
rate 10%–25% higher than the mean default rate of 5% (which
amounts to roughly a 0.5%–1% increase in delinquencies). As this
result is conditional on observable loan and borrower characteristics, the only remaining difference between the loans around
the threshold is the increased ease of securitization. Therefore,
the greater default probability of loans above the credit threshold
must be due to a reduction in screening by lenders.
Because our results are conditional on securitization, we conduct additional analyses to address selection on the part of borrowers, lenders, or investors as explanations for differences in
the performance of loans around the credit threshold. First, we
rule out borrower selection on observables, as the loan terms and
borrower characteristics are smooth across the FICO score threshold. Next, selection of loans by investors is mitigated because the

The figure presents the FICO distribution in the U.S. population for 2004. The

similar patterns during the other years of our sample. The FICO distribution

local vicinity of a given credit score is similar.

decisions of investors (special purpose vehicles, SPVs) are based
on the same (smooth–through the threshold) loan and borrower
variables as in our data (Kornfeld 2007).
Finally, strategic adverse selection on the part of lenders may
also be a concern. However, lenders offer the entire pool of loans
to investors, and, conditional on observables, SPVs largely follow
a randomized selection rule to create bundles of loans out of these
pools, suggesting that securitized loans would look similar to those
that remain on the balance sheet (Comptroller’s Handbook 1997;
Gorton and Souleles 2006). Furthermore, if at all present, this
selection will tend to be more severe below the threshold, thereby
biasing the results against our finding any screening effect. We
also constrain our analysis to a subset of lenders who are not susceptible to strategic securitization of loans. The results for these
lenders are qualitatively similar to the findings using the full
sample, highlighting that screening is the driving force behind
our results.

Could the 620 threshold be set by lenders as an optimal cutoff for screening that is unrelated to differential securitization?
We investigate further using a natural experiment in the passage and subsequent repeal of antipredatory laws in New Jersey
(2002) and Georgia (2003) that varied the ease of securitization
around the threshold. If lenders used 620 as an optimal cutoff for
screening unrelated to securitization, we would expect the passage of these laws to have no effect on the differential screening
standards around the threshold. However, if these laws affected
the differential ease of securitization around the threshold, our
hypothesis would predict an impact on the screening standards.
Our results confirm that the discontinuity in the number of loans
around the threshold diminished during a period of strict enforcement of antipredatory lending laws. In addition, there was a rapid
return of a discontinuity after the law was revoked. Importantly,
our performance results follow the same pattern, that is, screening differentials attenuated only during the period of enforcement.
Taken together, this evidence suggests that our results are indeed
related to differential securitization at the credit threshold and
that lenders did not follow the rule of thumb in all instances.
Importantly, the natural experiment also suggests that primeinfluenced selection is not at play.
Once we have confirmed that lenders are screening more rigorously at 620− than 620+ , we assess whether borrowers were
aware of the differential screening around the threshold. Although
there is no difference in contract terms around the cutoff, borrowers may have an incentive to manipulate their credit scores
in order to take advantage of differential screening around the
threshold (consistent with our central claim). Aside from outright fraud, it is difficult to strategically manipulate one’s FICO
score in a targeted manner and any actions to improve one’s score
take relatively long periods of time, on the order of three to six
months (Fair Isaac). Nonetheless, we investigate further using
the same natural experiment evaluating the performance effects
over a relatively short time horizon. The results reveal a rapid
return of a discontinuity in loan performance around the 620
threshold, which suggests that rather than manipulation, our results are largely driven by differential screening on the part of
lenders.
As a test of the role of soft information in screening incentives of lenders, we investigate the full documentation loan market. These loans have potentially significant hard information

because complete background information about the borrower’s
ability to repay is provided. In this market, we identify another
credit cutoff, a FICO score of 600, based on the advice of the three
credit repositories. We find that twice as many full documentation loans are securitized above the credit threshold at 600+ as
below the threshold at 600− . Interestingly, however, we find no
significant difference in default rates of full documentation loans
originated around this credit threshold. This result suggests that
despite a difference in ease of securitization across the threshold, differences in the returns to screening are attenuated due to
the presence of more hard information. Our findings for full documentation loans suggest that the role of soft information is crucial
to understanding what worked and what did not in the existing
securitized subprime loan market. We discuss this issue in more
detail in Section VI.
This paper connects several strands of the literature. Our
evidence sheds new light on the subprime housing crisis, as
discussed in the contemporaneous work of Doms, Furlong, and
Krainer (2007), Gerardi, Shapiro, and Willen (2007), Dell’Ariccia,
Igan, and Laeven (2008), Mayer, Piskorski, and Tchistyi (2008),
Rajan, Seru, and Vig (2008), Benmelech and Dlugosz (2009), Mian
and Sufi (2009), and Demyanyk and Van Hemert (2010).2 This
paper also speaks to the literature that discusses the benefits
(Kashyap and Stein 2000; Loutskina and Strahan 2007), and the
costs (Morrison 2005; Parlour and Plantin 2008) of securitization.
In a related line of research, Drucker and Mayer (2008) document
how underwriters exploit inside information to their advantage in
secondary mortgage markets, and Gorton and Pennacchi (1995),
Sufi (2006), and Drucker and Puri (2009) investigate how contract
terms are structured to mitigate some of these agency conflicts.3
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II provides a brief overview of lending in the subprime market and describes the data and sample construction. Section III discusses the
framework and empirical methodology used in the paper, whereas
Sections IV and V present the empirical results in the paper. Section VI concludes.

II. LENDING IN THE SUBPRIME MORTGAGE MARKET
II.A. Background
Approximately 60% of outstanding U.S. mortgage debt is
traded in mortgage-backed securities (MBS), making the U.S. secondary mortgage market the largest fixed-income market in the
world (Chomsisengphet and Pennington-Cross 2006). The bulk of
this securitized universe ($3.6 trillion outstanding as of January
2006) is composed of agency pass-through pools—those issued by
Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and Ginnie Mae. The remainder, approximately, $2.1 trillion as of January 2006, has been securitized
in nonagency securities. Although the nonagency MBS market
is relatively small as a percentage of all U.S. mortgage debt, it
is nevertheless large on an absolute dollar basis. The two markets are separated based on the eligibility criteria of loans that
the GSEs have established. Broadly, agency eligibility is established on the basis of loan size, credit score, and underwriting
standards.
Unlike the agency market, the nonagency (referred to as “subprime” in the paper) market was not always this size. This market gained momentum in the mid- to late 1990s. Inside B&C
Lending—a publication that covers subprime mortgage lending
extensively—reports that total subprime lending (B&C originations) grew from $65 billion in 1995 to $500 billion in 2005. Growth
in mortgage-backed securities led to an increase in securitization
rates (the ratio of the dollar value of loans securitized divided by
the dollar value of loans originated) from less than 30% in 1995
to over 80% in 2006.
From the borrower’s perspective, the primary feature distinguishing between prime and subprime loans is that the up-front
and continuing costs are higher for subprime loans.4 The subprime mortgage market actively prices loans based on the risk
associated with the borrower. Specifically, the interest rate on the
loan depends on credit scores, debt-to-income ratios, and the documentation level of the borrower. In addition, the exact pricing
may depend on loan-to-value ratios (the amount of equity of the
borrower), the length of the loan, the flexibility of the interest
rate (adjustable, fixed, or hybrid), the lien position, the property
4. Up-front costs include application fees, appraisal fees, and other fees associated with originating a mortgage. The continuing costs include mortgage insurance
payments, principal and interest payments, late fees for delinquent payments, and
fees levied by a locality (such as property taxes and special assessments).

type, and whether stipulations are made for any prepayment
penalties.5
For investors who hold the eventual mortgage-backed security, credit risk in the agency sector is mitigated by an implicit or
explicit government guarantee, but subprime securities have no
such guarantee. Instead, credit enhancement for nonagency deals
is in most cases provided internally by means of a deal structure that bundles loans into “tranches,” or segments of the overall
portfolio (Lucas, Goodman, and Fabozzi 2006).
II.B. Data
Our primary data set contains individual loan data leased
from LoanPerformance. The database is the only source that provides a detailed perspective on the nonagency securities market.
The data include information on issuers, broker dealers/deal underwriters, servicers, master servicers, bond and trust administrators, trustees, and other third parties. As of December 2006,
more than eight thousand home equity and nonprime loan pools
(over seven thousand active) that include 16.5 million loans (more
than seven million active) with over $1.6 trillion in outstanding
balances were included. LoanPerformance estimates that as of
2006, the data cover over 90% of the subprime loans that are
securitized.6 The data set includes all standard loan application
variables such as the loan amount, term, LTV ratio, credit score,
and interest rate type—all data elements that are disclosed and
form the basis of contracts in nonagency securitized mortgage
pools. We now describe some of these variables in more detail.
For our purpose, the most important piece of information
about a particular loan is the creditworthiness of the borrower.
The borrower’s credit quality is captured by a summary measure
called the FICO score. FICO scores are calculated using various measures of credit history, such as types of credit in use and
5. For example, the rate and underwriting matrix of Countrywide Home Loans
Inc., a leading lender of prime and subprime loans, shows how the credit score of
the borrower and the loan-to-value ratio are used to determine the rates at which
different documentation-level loans are made (www.countrywide.com).
6. Note that only loans that are securitized are reported in the LoanPerformance database. Communication with the database provider suggests that the
roughly 10% of loans that are not reported are for privacy concerns from lenders.
Importantly for our purpose, the exclusion is not based on any selection criteria that the vendor follows (e.g., loan characteristics or borrower characteristics).
Moreover, based on estimates provided by LoanPerformance, the total number of
nonagency loans securitized relative to all loans originated has increased from
about 65% in early 2000 to over 92% since 2004.

amount of outstanding debt, but do not include any information
about a borrower’s income or assets (Fishelson-Holstein 2005).
The software used to generate the score from individual credit reports is licensed by the Fair Isaac Corporation to the three major
credit repositories—TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax. These
repositories, in turn, sell FICO scores and credit reports to lenders
and consumers. FICO scores provide a ranking of potential borrowers by the probability of having some negative credit event
in the next two years. Probabilities are rescaled into a range of
400–900, though nearly all scores are between 500 and 800, with
a higher score implying a lower probability of a negative event.
The negative credit events foreshadowed by the FICO score can
be as small as one missed payment or as large as bankruptcy. Borrowers with lower scores are proportionally more likely to have
all types of negative credit events than are borrowers with higher
scores.
FICO scores have been found to be accurate even for
low-income and minority populations (see Fair Isaac website
www.myfico.com; also see Chomsisengphet and Pennington-Cross
[2006]). More importantly, the applicability of scores available at
loan origination extends reliably up to two years. By design, FICO
measures the probability of a negative credit event over a twoyear horizon. Mortgage lenders, on the other hand, are interested
in credit risk over a much longer period of time. The continued
acceptance of FICO scores in automated underwriting systems
indicates that there is a level of comfort with their value in determining lifetime default probability differences.7 Keeping this as a
backdrop, most of our tests of borrower default will examine the
default rates up to 24 months from the time the loan is originated.
Borrower quality can also be gauged by the level of documentation collected by the lender when taking the loan. The documents collected provide historical and current information about
the income and assets of the borrower. Documentation in the market (and reported in the database) is categorized as full, limited,
or no documentation. Borrowers with full documentation provide
verification of income as well as assets. Borrowers with limited
documentation provide no information about their income but do
7. An econometric study by Freddie Mac researchers showed that the predictive power of FICO scores drops by about 25% once one moves to a three to
five–year performance window (Holloway, MacDonald, and Straka 1993). FICO
scores are still predictive, but do not contribute as much to the default rate probability equation after the first two years.

provide some information about their assets. “No-documentation”
borrowers provide no information about income or assets, which
is a very rare degree of screening lenience on the part of lenders.
In our analysis, we combine limited and no-documentation borrowers and call them low-documentation borrowers. Our results
are unchanged if we remove the very small portion of loans that
are no-documentation.
Finally, there is also information about the property being financed by the borrower, and the purpose of the loan. Specifically,
we have information on the type of mortgage loan (fixed rate, adjustable rate, balloon, or hybrid) and the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio
of the loan, which measures the amount of the loan expressed as
a percentage of the value of the home. Typically loans are classified as either for purchase or refinance, though for convenience
we focus exclusively on loans for home purchases.8 Information
about the geography where the dwelling is located (ZIP code) is
also available in the database.9
Most of the loans in our sample are for owner-occupied
single-family residences, townhouses, or condominiums (singleunit loans account for more than 90% of the loans in our sample). Therefore, to ensure reasonable comparisons, we restrict the
loans in our sample to these groups. We also drop nonconventional properties, such as those that are FHA- or VA-insured or
pledged properties, and also exclude buy down mortgages. We
also exclude Alt-A loans, because the coverage for these loans in
the database is limited. Only those loans with valid FICO scores
are used in our sample. We conduct our analysis for the period
January 2001 to December 2006, because the securitization market in the subprime market grew to a meaningful size post-2000
(Gramlich 2007).
III. FRAMEWORK AND METHODOLOGY
When a borrower approaches a lender for a mortgage loan, the
lender asks the borrower to fill out a credit application. In addition, the lender obtains the borrower’s credit report from the three
credit bureaus. Part of the background information on the application and report could be considered “hard” information (e.g.,
8. We find similar rules of thumb and default outcomes in the refinance
market.

and variation in regulation, driven by the geography of loans and the type of lender.

the FICO score of the borrower), whereas the rest is “soft” (e.g.,
a measure of future income stability of the borrower, how many
years of documentation were provided by the borrower, joint income status) in the sense that it is less easy to summarize on a
legal contract. The lender expends effort to process the soft and
hard information about the borrower and, based on this assessment, offers a menu of contracts to the borrower. Subsequently,
the borrower decides to accept or decline the loan contract offered
by the lender.
Once a loan contract has been accepted, the loan can be sold
as part of a securitized pool to investors. Notably, only the hard
information about the borrower (FICO score) and the contractual
terms (e.g., LTV ratio, interest rate) are used by investors when
buying these loans as part of a securitized pool.10 In fact, the
variables about the borrowers and the loan terms in the LoanPerformance database are identical to those used by investors and
rating agencies to rate tranches of the securitized pool. Therefore,
although lenders are compensated for the hard information about
the borrower, the incentive for lenders to process soft information
critically depends on whether they have to bear the risk of loans
they originate (Gorton and Pennacchi 1995; Parlour and Plantin
2008; Rajan, Seru, and Vig 2008). The central claim in this paper is that lenders are less likely to expend effort to process soft
information as the ease of securitization increases.
We exploit a specific rule of thumb at the FICO score of
620 that makes securitization of loans more likely if a certain
FICO score threshold is attained. Historically, this score was established as a minimum threshold in the mid-1990s by Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac in their guidelines on loan eligibility (Avery
et al. 1996; Capone 2002). Guidelines by Freddie Mac suggest that
FICO scores below 620 are placed in the Cautious Review Category, and Freddie Mac considers a score below 620 “as a strong
indication that the borrower’s credit reputation is not acceptable”
(Freddie Mac 2001, 2007).11 This is also reflected in Fair Isaac’s
statement, “. . . those agencies [Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac],
which buy mortgages from banks and resell them to investors,

Credit, U.S. House of Representatives, May 8, 2007.
11. These guidelines appeared at least as far back as 1995 in a letter by
the Executive Vice President of Freddie Mac (Michael K. Stamper) to the CEOs

have indicated to lenders that any consumer with a FICO score
above 620 is good, while consumers below 620 should result in further inquiry from the lender. . . . ” Although the GSEs actively securitized loans when the nascent subprime market was relatively
small, this role shifted entirely to investment banks and hedge
funds (the nonagency sector) in recent times (Gramlich 2007).
We argue that adherence to this cutoff by subprime MBS investors, following the advice of GSEs, generates an increase in
demand for securitized loans that are just above the credit cutoff
relative to loans below this cutoff. There is widespread evidence
that is consistent with 620 being a rule of thumb in the securitized subprime lending market. For instance, rating agencies
(Fitch and Standard and Poor’s) used this cutoff to determine
default probabilities of loans when rating mortgage-backed securities with subprime collateral (Loesch 1996; Temkin, Johnson,
and Levy 2002). Similarly, Calomiris and Mason (1999) survey the
high-risk mortgage loan market and find 620 as a rule of thumb
for subprime loans. We also confirmed this view by conducting a
survey of origination matrices used by several of the top fifty originators in the subprime market (a list obtained from Inside B&C
Lending; these lenders amount to about 70% of loan volume). The
credit threshold of 620 was used by nearly all the lenders.
Because investors purchase securitized loans based on hard
information, our assertion is that the cost of collecting soft information is internalized by lenders when screening borrowers
at 620− to a greater extent than at 620+ . There is widespread
anecdotal evidence that lenders in the subprime market review
both soft and hard information more carefully for borrowers with
credit scores below 620. For instance, the website of Advantage
Mortgage, a subprime securitized loan originator, claims that
“. . . all loans with credit scores below 620 require a second level
review. . . . There are no exceptions, regardless of the strengths of
the collateral or capacity components of the loan.”12 By focusing
on the lender as a unit of observation, we attempt to learn about
the differential impact ease of securitization had on the behavior
of lenders around the cutoff.
To begin with, our tests empirically identify a statistical discontinuity in the distribution of loans securitized around the
credit threshold of 620. In order to do so, we show that the number
12. This position for loans below 620 is reflected in lending guidelines of
numerous other subprime lenders.

of loans securitized dramatically increases when we move along
the FICO distribution from 620− to 620+ . We argue that this is
equivalent to showing that the unconditional probability of securitization increases as one moves from 620− to 620+ . To see

at 620 and 620 , respectively. Showing that Ns620 > Ns620 is
620+
620−
equivalent to showing that Ns /Np > Ns /Np, where Np is
the number of prospective borrowers at 620+ or 620− . If we assume that the numbers of prospective borrowers at 620+ and 620−
−
+
are similar, that is, Np620 ≈ Np620 = Np (a reasonable assumption,
as discussed below), then the unconditional probability of securitization is higher at 620+ . We refer to the difference in these
unconditional probabilities as the differential ease of securitization around the threshold. Notably, our assertion of differential
screening by lenders does not rely on knowledge of the proportion
of prospective borrowers that applied, were rejected, or were held
on the lenders’ balance sheet. We simply require that lenders are
aware that a prospective borrower at 620+ has a higher likelihood
of eventual securitization.
We measure the extent of the jump by using techniques that
are commonly used in the literature on regression discontinuity (e.g., see DiNardo and Lee [2004]; Card, Mas, and Rothstein
[2008]). Specifically, we collapse the data on each FICO score (500–
800) i and estimate equations of the form
(1)

Yi = α + βTi + θ f (FICO(i)) + δTi · f (FICO(i)) + i ,

where Yi is the number of loans at FICO score i, Ti is an indicator that takes a value of 1 at FICO ≥ 620 and a value of 0
if FICO < 620 and i is a mean-zero error term. f (FICO) and
T · f (FICO) are flexible seventh-order polynomials, with the goal
of these functions being to fit the smoothed curves on either
side of the cutoff as closely to the data presented in the figures
as possible.13 f (FICO) is estimated from 620− to the left, and
T · f (FICO) is estimated from 620+ to the right. The magnitude
of the discontinuity, β, is estimated by the difference in these
two smoothed functions evaluated at the cutoff. The data are
re-centered such that FICO = 620 corresponds to “0,” thus at the
13. We have also estimated these functions of the FICO score using third-order
and fifth-order polynomials in FICO, as well as relaxing parametric assumptions
and estimating using local linear regression. The estimates throughout are not
sensitive to the specification of these functions. In Section IV, we also examine
the size and power of the test using the seventh-order polynomial specification
following the approach of Card, Mas, and Rothstein (2008).

cutoff the polynomials are evaluated at 0 and drop out of the calculation, which allows β to be interpreted as the magnitude of
the discontinuity at the FICO threshold. This coefficient should
be interpreted locally in the immediate vicinity of the credit score
threshold.
After documenting a large jump at the ad-hoc credit thresholds, we focus on the performance of the loans around these thresholds. We evaluate the performance of the loans by examining the
default probability of loans—that is, whether or not the loan defaulted t months after it was originated. If lenders screen similarly
for the loan of credit quality 620+ and the loan of 620− credit quality, there should not be any discernible differences in default rates
of these loans. Our maintained claim is that any differences in default rates on either side of the cutoff, after controlling for hard
information, should be only due to the impact that securitization
has on lenders’ screening standards.
This claim relies on several identification assumptions. First,
as we approach the cutoff from either side, any differences in
the characteristics of prospective borrowers are assumed to be
random. This implies that the underlying creditworthiness and
the demand for mortgage loans (at a given price) is the same
for prospective buyers with a credit score of 620− or 620+ . This
seems reasonable as it amounts to saying that the calculation Fair
Isaac performs (using a logistic function) to generate credit scores
has a random error component around any specific score. Figure I
shows the FICO distribution in the U.S. population in 2004. These
data are from an anonymous credit bureau that assures us that
the data exhibit similar patterns during the other years of our
sample. Note that the FICO distribution across the population
is smooth, so the number of prospective borrowers across a given
−
+
credit score is similar (in the example above, Np620 ≈ Np620 = Np).
Second, we assume that screening is costly for the lender.
The collection of information—hard systematic data (e.g., FICO
score) as well as soft information (e.g., joint income status) about
the creditworthiness of the borrower—requires time and effort by
loan officers. If lenders did not have to expend resources to collect
information, it would be difficult to argue that the differences
in performance we estimate are a result of ease of securitization
around the credit threshold affecting banks incentives to screen
and monitor. Again, this seems to be a reasonable assumption (see
Gorton and Pennacchi [1995]).
Note that our discussion thus far has assumed that there is no
explicit manipulation of FICO scores by the lenders or borrowers.

Notes. Information on subprime home purchase loans comes from LoanPerformance. Sample period is
2001–2006. See text for sample selection.

However, the borrower may have incentives to do so if loan contracts or screening differ around the threshold. Our analysis in
Section IV.F focuses on a natural experiment and shows that the
effects of securitization on performance are not being driven by
strategic manipulation.
IV. MAIN EMPIRICAL RESULTS
IV.A. Descriptive Statistics
As noted earlier, the nonagency market differs from the
agency market on three dimensions: FICO scores, loan-to-value
ratios, and the amount of documentation asked of the borrower.
We next look at the descriptive statistics of our sample, with special emphasis on these dimensions. Our analysis uses more than
one million loans across the period 2001 to 2006. As mentioned
earlier, the nonagency securitization market has grown dramatically since 2000, which is apparent in Panel A of Table I, which

shows the number of subprime loans securitized across years.
These patterns are similar to those described in Gramlich (2007)
and Demyanyk and Van Hemert (2010). The market has witnessed
an increase in the number of loans with reduced hard information
in the form of limited or no documentation. Note that whereas
limited documentation provides no information about income but
does provide some information about assets, a no-documentation
loan provides information about neither income nor assets. In
our analysis we combine both types of limited-documentation
loans and denote them as low-documentation loans. The fulldocumentation market grew by 445% from 2001 to 2005, whereas
the number of low-documentation loans grew by 972%.
We find similar trends for loan-to-value ratios and FICO
scores in the two documentation groups. LTV ratios have gone
up over time, as borrowers have put less and less equity into their
homes when financing loans. This increase is consistent with better willingness of market participants to absorb risk. In fact, this
is often considered the bright side of securitization—borrowers
are able to borrow at better credit terms because risk is being
borne by investors who can bear more risk than individual banks.
Panel A also shows that average FICO scores of individuals who
access the subprime market have been increasing over time. The
mean FICO score among low-documentation borrowers increased
from 630 in 2001 to 655 in 2006. This increase in average FICO
scores is consistent with the rule of thumb leading to a larger expansion of the market above the 620 threshold. Average LTV ratios are lower and FICO scores higher for the low-documentation
as compared to the full-documentation sample. This possibly reflects the additional uncertainty lenders have about the quality of
low-documentation borrowers.
Panel B compares the low- and full-documentation segments
of the subprime market on a number of the explanatory variables used in the analysis. Low-documentation loans are on average larger and are given to borrowers with higher credit scores
than loans where full information on income and assets is provided. However, the two groups of loans have similar contract
terms such as interest rate, loan-to-value, prepayment penalties, and whether the interest rate is adjustable or not. Our
analysis below focuses first on the low-documentation segment
of the market; we explore the full-documentation market in
Section V.

IV.B. Establishing the Rule of Thumb
We first present results that show that large differences exist
in the number of low-documentation loans that are securitized
around the credit threshold we described earlier. We then examine
whether this jump in securitization has any consequences on the
subsequent performance of the loans above and below this credit
threshold.
As mentioned in Section III, the rule of thumb in the lending
market impacts the ease of securitization around a credit score
of 620. We therefore expect to see a substantial increase in the
number of loans just above this credit threshold as compared to
number of loans just below this threshold. In order to examine
this, we start by plotting the number of loans at each FICO score
in the two documentation categories around the credit cutoff of
620 across years starting with 2001 and ending in 2006. As can be
seen from Figure II, there is a marked increase in number of lowdocumentation loans at 620+ relative to the number of loans at
620− . We do not find any such jump for full-documentation loans
at FICO of 620.14 Given this evidence, we focus on the 620 credit
threshold for low-documentation loans.
From Figure II, it is clear that the number of loans see roughly
a 100% jump in 2004 for low-documentation loans across the credit
score of 620—there are twice as many loans securitized at 620+ at
620− . Clearly, this is consistent with the hypothesis that the ease
of securitization is higher at 620+ than at scores just below this
credit cutoff.
To estimate the jumps in the number of loans, we use the
methods described above in Section III using the specification
provided in equation (1). As reported in Table II, we find that
low-documentation loans see a dramatic increase above the credit
threshold of 620. In particular, the coefficient estimate (β) is significant at the 1% level and is on average around 110% (from 73%
to 193%) higher for 620+ as compared to 620− for loans during the
sample period. For instance, in 2001, the estimated discontinuity
in Panel A is 85. The mean average number of low-documentation
loans at a FICO score for 2001 is 117. The ratio is around 73%.
These jumps are plainly visible from the yearly graphs in Figure I.
In addition, we conduct permutation tests (or “randomization” tests), where we vary the location of the discontinuity (Ti )
14. We will elaborate more on full-documentation loans in Section V.

Number of Loans (Low-Documentation)
The figure presents the data for number of low-documentation loans (in ’00s).
We plot the average number of loans at each FICO score between 500 and 800.
As can be seen from the graphs, there is a large increase in the number of loans
around the 620 credit threshold (i.e., more loans at 620+ as compared to 620− )
from 2001 onward. Data are for loans originated between 2001 and 2006.

Notes. This table reports estimates from a regression that uses the number of low-documentation loans at
each FICO score as the dependent variable. In order to estimate the discontinuity (FICO ≥ 620) for each year,
we collapse the number of loans at each FICO score and estimate flexible seventh-order polynomials on either
side of the 620 cutoff, allowing for a discontinuity at 620. We report t-statistics in parentheses. Permutation
tests, which allow for a discontinuity at every point in the FICO distribution, confirm that jumps for each
year are significantly larger than those found elsewhere in the distribution (see Section IV.B for more details).
For brevity, we report a permutation test estimate from pooled regressions with time fixed effects removed
to account for vintage effects. FICO = 620 has the smallest permutation test p-value (and is thus the largest
outlier) among all the visible discontinuities in our sample.

across the range of all possible FICO scores and reestimate equation (1). The test treats every value of the FICO distribution as
a potential discontinuity, and estimates the magnitude of the
observed discontinuity at each point, forming a counter factual
distribution of discontinuity estimates. This is equivalent to a
bootstrapping procedure that varies the cutoff but does not resample the order of the points in the distribution (Johnston and
DiNardo 1996). We then compare the value of the estimated discontinuity at 620 to the counterfactual distribution and construct
a test statistic based on the asymptotic normality of the counterfactual distribution and report the p-value from this test. The null
hypothesis is that the estimated discontinuity at a FICO score of
620 is the mean of the 300 possible discontinuities.15
The precision of the permutation test is limited by the number
of observations used at each FICO score. As a result, regressions
that pool across years provide the greatest power for statistical
testing. While constructing the counterfactuals, we therefore use
pooled specifications with year fixed effects removed to account for
differences in vintage. The result of this test is shown in Table II
and shows that the estimate at 620 for low-documentation loans is
a strong outlier relative to the estimated jumps at other locations
in the distribution. The estimated discontinuity when the years
are pooled together is 780 loans with a permutation test p-value
of .003. In summary, if the underlying creditworthiness and the
demand for mortgage loans are the same for potential buyers with
a credit score of 620− or 620+ , this result confirms that it is easier
to securitize loans above the FICO threshold.
IV.C. Contract Terms and Borrower Demographics
Before examining the subsequent performance of loans
around the credit threshold, we first assess whether there are
any differences in hard information—either in contract terms or
in other borrower characteristics—around this threshold. The endogeneity of contractual terms based on the riskiness of borrowers
may lead to different contracts and hence different types of borrowers obtaining loans around the threshold in a systematic way.
15. In unreported tests, we also conduct a falsification simulation exercise
following Card, Mas, and Rothstein (2008). In particular, we apply our specification
to data generated by a continuous process. We reject the null hypothesis of no effect
(using a two-sided 5% test) in 6.0% of the simulations, indicating that the size of
our test is reasonable. A similar test with data generated by a discontinuous
process suggests that the power of our test is also reasonable. We reject the null
of no effect about 92% of the times (in a two-sided 5% test) in this case.

FIGURE III
Interest Rates (Low-Documentation)
The figure presents the data for interest rate (in %) on low-documentation
loans. We plot average interest rates on loans at each FICO score between 500 and
800. As can be seen from the graphs, there is no change in interest rates around
the 620 credit threshold (i.e., more loans at 620+ as compared to 620− ) from 2001
onward. Data are for loans originated between 2001 and 2006.

Though we control for the possible contract differences when we
evaluate the performance of loans, it is a source of insight to examine whether borrower and contract terms also systematically
differ around the credit threshold.
We start by examining the contract terms—LTV ratio and interest rates—across the credit threshold. Figures III and IV show
the distributions of interest rates and LTV ratios offered on lowdocumentation loans across the FICO spectrum. As is apparent,
we find these loan terms to be very similar—that is, we find no differences in contract terms for low-documentation loans above and
below the 620 credit score. We test this formally using an approach
equivalent to equation (1), replacing the dependent variable Yi
in the regression framework with contract terms (loan-to-value
ratios and interest rates) and present the results in Appendix
I.A. Our results suggest that there is no difference in loan terms
across the credit threshold. For instance, for low-documentation
loans originated in 2006, the average loan-to-value ratio across the

Loan-to-Value Ratio (Low-Documentation)
The figure presents the data for loan-to-value ratio (in %) on low-documentation
loans. We plot average loan-to-value ratios on loans at each FICO score between
500 and 800. As can be seen from the graphs, there is no change in loan-to-value
around the 620 credit threshold (i.e., more loans at 620+ as compared to 620− )
from 2001 onward. Data are for loans originated between 2001 and 2006.

collapsed FICO spectrum is 85%, whereas our estimated discontinuity is only −1.05%, a 1.2% difference. Similarly for the interest
rate, for low-documentation loans originated in 2005, the average
interest rate is 8.2%, and the difference on either side of the credit
score cutoff is only about −0.091%, a 1% difference. Permutation
tests reported in Appendix I.D confirm that these differences are
not outliers relative to the estimated jumps at other locations in
the distribution.
Additional contract terms, such as the presence of a prepayment penalty, or whether the loan is ARM, FRM, or interest only/balloon are also similar across the 620 threshold (results
not shown). In addition, if loans have second liens, then a combined LTV (CLTV) ratio is calculated. We find no difference in the
CLTV ratios around the threshold for those borrowers with more
than one lien on the home. Finally, low-documentation loans often do not require that borrowers provide information about their

Median Household Income (Low-Documentation)
The figure presents median household income (in ’000s) of ZIP codes in which
loans are made at each FICO score between 500 and 800. As can be seen from
the graphs, there is no change in median household income around the 620 credit
threshold (i.e., more loans at 620+ as compared to 620− ) from 2001 onward. We
plotted similar distributions for average percent minorities taking loans and average house size and found no differences around the credit thresholds. Data are

income, so only a subset of our sample provides a debt-to-income
(DTI) ratio for the borrowers. Among this subsample, there is no
difference in DTI across the 620 threshold in low-documentation
loans. For brevity, we report only the permutation tests for these
contract terms in Appendix I.D.
Next, we examine whether the characteristics of borrowers
differ systematically across the credit threshold. In order to evaluate this, we look at the distribution of the population of borrowers
across the FICO spectrum for low-documentation loans. The data
on borrower demographics come from Census 2000 and are at the
ZIP code level. As can be seen from Figure V, median household
incomes of the ZIP codes of borrowers around the credit thresholds
look very similar for low-documentation loans. We plotted similar
distributions for average percent minorities residing in the ZIP
code and average house value in the ZIP code across the FICO

spectrum (unreported) and again find no differences across the
credit threshold.16
We use the same specification as equation (1), this time with
the borrower demographic characteristics as dependent variables
and present the results formally in Appendix I.B. Consistent with
the patterns in the figures, permutation tests (unreported) reveal
no differences in borrower demographic characteristics around
the credit score threshold. Overall, our results indicate that observable characteristics of loans and borrowers are not different
around the credit threshold.
IV.D. Performance of Loans
We now focus on the performance of loans that are originated
close to the credit score threshold. Note that our analysis in Section IV.C suggests that there is no difference in terms of observable
hard information about contract terms or about borrower demographic characteristics across the credit score thresholds. Nevertheless, we will control for these differences when evaluating the
subsequent performance of loans in our logit regressions. If there
is any remaining difference in the performance of the loans above
and below the credit threshold, it can be attributed to differences
in unobservable soft information about the loans.
We estimate the differences in default rates on either side of
the cutoff using the same framework as equation (1), using the
dollar-weighted fraction of loans defaulted within ten to fifteen
months of origination as the dependent variable, Yi . This fraction
is calculated as the dollar amount of unpaid loans in default divided by the total dollar amount originated in the same cohort. We
classify a loan as under default if any of the conditions is true: (a)
payments on the loan are 60+ days late as defined by the Office of
Thrift Supervision; (b) the loan is in foreclosure; or (c) the loan is
real estate owned (REO), that is, the bank has retaken possession
of the home.17
16. Of course, because the census data are at the ZIP code level, we are to
some extent smoothing our distributions. We note, however, that when we conduct
our analysis on differences in number of loans (from Section IV.B), aggregated
at the ZIP code level, we still find jumps across the credit threshold within each
individual ZIP code.
17. Although two different definitions of delinquency are used in the industry
(Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) definition and Office of Thrift Supervision
(OTS) definition), we have followed the more stringent OTS definition. Whereas
MBA starts counting days a loan has been delinquent from the time a payment is
missed, OTS counts days a loan is delinquent one month after the first payment is
missed.

We collapse the data into one-point FICO bins and estimate
seventh-order polynomials on either side of the threshold for each
year. By estimating the magnitude of β in each year separately,
we ensure that no one cohort (or vintage) of loans is driving our
results. As shown in Figures VI.A to VI.F, the low-documentation
loans exhibit discontinuities in default rates at the FICO score of
620. A year-by-year estimate is presented in Panel A of Table III.
Contrary to what one might expect, around the credit threshold,
we find that loans with higher credit scores actually default more
often than lower credit loans in the post-2000 period. In particular,
for loans originated in 2005, the estimate of β is 0.023 (t-stat
= 2.10), and the mean delinquency rate is 0.078, suggesting a
29% increase in defaults to the right of the credit score cutoff.
Similarly, in 2006, the estimated size of the jump is 0.044 (t-stat
= 2.68), and the mean delinquency rate for all FICO bins is 0.155,
which is again a 29% increase in defaults around the FICO score
threshold.
Panel B presents results of permutation tests, estimated on
the residuals obtained after pooling delinquency rates across
years and removing year effects. Besides the 60+ late delinquency
definition used in Panel A, we also classify a loan as in default if
it is 90+ late in payments and if it is in foreclosure or REO. Our
approach yields similar, if not stronger, results. Compared to 620−
loans, 620+ loans are on average 2.8% more likely to be in arrears
of 90+ days and 2.5% more likely to be in foreclosure or REO.
Permutation test p-values confirm that the jump in defaults at
620 using all the definitions of default are extreme outliers to the
rest of the delinquency distribution. For instance, with default defined as foreclosure/REO, the p-value for the discontinuity at 620
is .004. That we find similar results using different default definitions is consistent with high levels of rollover, whereby loans that
are delinquent continue to reach deeper levels of delinquency. As
shown in Online Appendix Table 1, more than 80% of loans that
are 60 days delinquent reach 90+ days delinquent within a year,
and 66% of loans that are 90 days delinquent reach foreclosure
twelve months after in the low documentation market.
Although previous default definitions were dollar-weighted,
we also use the raw number of loans in default to estimate the
magnitude of the discontinuity in loan performance around the
FICO threshold. The unweighted results with 60+ delinquency
are also presented in Panel B, and continue to exhibit a pattern
of higher credit scores leading to higher default rates across the

Notes. In Panel A, we estimate the differences in default rates using a flexible seventh-order polynomial
on either side of the 620 cutoff, allowing for a discontinuity at 620. The 60+ dollar-weighted fraction of loans
defaulted within 10–15 months is the dependent variable. In Panel B, we present estimates from permutation
tests from pooled regressions with time fixed effects removed to account for vintage effects using specification
similar to Panel A. Permutation tests confirm that the discontinuity at 620 has the smallest p-value (and is
thus largest outlier) in our sample. We use alternative definitions of defaults as the dependent variable. In
Panel C, we estimate differences in default rates on either side of the 620 FICO cut off using a logit regression.
The dependent variable is the delinquency status of a loan in a given month that takes a value 1 if the loan
is classified as under default, as defined in the text. Controls include borrower and loan terms discussed in
Section IV. t-statistics are reported in parentheses (marginal effects are reported in square brackets).

Delinquencies for Low-Documentation Loans (2001–2006)
The figure presents the percent of low-documentation loans (dollar-weighted)
originated between 2001 and 2006 that subsequently became delinquent. We track
loans in two FICO buckets—615–619 (620− ) dashed and 620–624 (620+ ) solid—
from their origination date and plot the average loans that become delinquent each
month after the origination date. As can be seen, the higher credit score bucket
defaults more than the lower credit score bucket for the post-2000 period. For
brevity, we do not report plots separately for each year of origination. The effects
shown here in the pooled 2001–2006 plot are apparent in every year.

620 threshold. In fact, the results are statistically stronger than
the 60+ weighted results, with a permutation test p-value based
on the pooled estimates of .004 and the discontinuity estimate
being significant in all the years (unreported; see Online Appendix
Figure 4).
To show how delinquency rates evolve over the age of the
loan, in Figure VII we plot the delinquency rates of 620+ and
620− for low-documentation loans (dollar-weighted) by loan age.
As discussed earlier, we restrict our analysis to about two years
after the loan has been originated. As can be seen from the figure,
the differences in the delinquency rates are stark. The differences
begin around four months after the loans have been originated
and persist up to two years. Differences in default rates also seem
quite large in terms of magnitudes. Those with a credit score of

335

620− are about 20% less likely to default after a year as compared
to loans with credit score 620+ .18
An alternative methodology is to measure the performance
of each unweighted loan by tracking whether or not it became
delinquent and estimate logit regressions of the following form:


(2)
Yikt =  α + βTit + γ1 Xikt + δ1 Tit ∗ Xikt + μt + ikt .
This logistic approach complements the regression discontinuity
framework, as we restrict the sample to the ten FICO points in
the immediate vicinity of 620 in order to maintain the same local
interpretation of the RD results. Moreover, we are also able to
directly control for the possibly endogenous loan terms around
the threshold. The dependent variable is an indicator variable
(Delinquency) for loan i originated in year t that takes a value
of 1 if the loan is classified as under default in month k after
origination as defined above. We drop the loan from the regression
once it is paid out after reaching the REO state. T takes the
value 1 if FICO is between 620 and 624, and 0 if it is between
615 and 619 for low-documentation loans, thus restricting the
analysis to the immediate vicinity of the cutoffs. Controls include
FICO scores, the interest rate on the loan, loan-to-value ratio,
and borrower demographic variables, as well as interaction of
these variables with T . We also include a dummy variable for
the type of loan (adjustable or fixed rate mortgage). We control
for the possible nonlinear effect of age of the loan on defaults by
including three dummy variables—which take a value of 1 if the
month since origination is 0–10, 11–20, and more than 20 months,
respectively. Year of origination fixed effects are included in the
estimation and standard errors are clustered at the loan level to
account for multiple loan delinquency observations in the data.
As can be seen from the logit coefficients in Panel C of Table III, results from this regression are qualitatively similar to
those reported in the figures. In particular, we find that β is positive when we estimate the regressions for low-documentation
loans. The economic magnitudes are similar to those in the
18. Note that Figure VII does not plot cumulative delinquencies. As loans
are paid out, say after a foreclosure, the unpaid balance for these loans falls
relative to the time when they entered into a 60+ state. This explains the dip in
delinquencies in the figure after about twenty months. Our results are similar if
we plot cumulative delinquencies, or delinquencies that are calculated using the
unweighted number of loans. Also note that the fact that we find no delinquencies
early on in the duration of the loan is not surprising, given that originators are
required to take back loans on their books if the loans default within three months.

figures as well. For instance, keeping all other variables at their
mean levels, low-documentation loans with credit score 620− are
about 10%–25% less likely to default after a year than lowdocumentation loans with credit score 620+ . These are large
magnitudes—for instance, note that the mean delinquency rate
for low-documentation loans is around 4.45%; the economic magnitude of the effects in column (2) suggests that the difference
in the absolute delinquency rate between loans around the credit
threshold is around 0.5%–1% for low documentation loans.19
To account for the possibility that lax screening might be correlated across different loans within the same vintage, we cluster
the loans for each vintage and report the results in columns (3)
and (4). Note that the RD regressions (Panel A) estimated separately by year also alleviate concerns about correlated errors
across different loans with the same vintage.
In the mortgage market, the other way for loans to leave the
pool is to be repaid in full through refinancing or outright purchase, known as prepayment. This prepayment risk decreases the
return to investing in mortgage-backed securities in a manner
similar to default risk (see, e.g., Gerardi, Shapiro, and Willen
[2007] and Mayer, Piskorski, and Tchistyi [2008]). To assess
whether there are any differences in actual prepayments around
the 620 threshold, we plot the prepayment seasoning curve for all
years 2001–2006 in Figure VIII. As can be observed, prepayments
of 620+ and 620− borrowers in the low-documentation market are
similar (also see permutation test in Appendix I.D). Nevertheless,
to formally account for prepayment rates, we also estimate a competing risk model using both prepayment and default as means
for exiting the sample. We use the Cox proportional hazard model
based on the econometric specification following Deng, Quigley,
and Van Order (2000). In unreported tests (Online Appendix Table 6), we find results that are similar to our logistic specification.
Finally, the reported specification uses five-point bins of FICO
scores around the threshold, but the results are similar (though
less precise) if we restrict the bins to fewer FICO scores on either
side of 620 (Online Appendix Table 2). This issue is also fully addressed by the regression discontinuity results reported in Panels
A and B, which use individual FICO score bins as the units of
19. Our logistic specification is equivalent to a hazard model if we drop loans
as soon as they hit the first indicator of delinquency (sixty days in default) and
include a full set of duration dummies. Doing so does not change the nature of our
results.

Actual Prepayments for Low-Documentation Loans (2001–2006)
The figure presents the percentage of low-documentation loans (dollar

We track loans in two FICO buckets—615–619 (620− ) dashed and 620–624 (620+ )
solid—from their origination dates and plot the average loans that prepaid each
month after the origination date. As can be seen, there are no differences in prepayments between the higher and lower credit score buckets. For brevity, we do

observation. In sum, we find that even after controlling for all observable characteristics of the loan contracts or borrowers, loans
made to borrowers with higher FICO scores perform worse around
the credit threshold.
IV.E. Selection Concerns
Because our results are conditional on securitization, we conduct additional analyses to address selection explanations on account of borrowers, investors, and lenders for the differences in
the performance of loans around the credit threshold. First, contract terms offered to borrowers above the credit threshold might
differ from those below the threshold and attract a riskier pool
of borrowers. If this were the case, it would not be surprising if
the loans above the credit threshold performed worse than those
below it. As shown in Section IV.C, loan terms are smooth through
the FICO score threshold. We also investigate the loan terms in

more detail than in Section IV.C by examining the distribution of
interest rates and loan-to-value ratios of contracts offered around
620 for low-documentation loans.
Figure IX.A depicts the Epanechnikov kernel density of the
interest rate on low documentation loans in the year 2004 for two
FICO groups—620− (615–619) and 620+ (620–624). The distributions of interest rates observed in the two groups lie directly on
top of one another. A Kolmogorov–Smirnov test for equality of distribution functions cannot be rejected at the 1% level. Similarly,
Figure IX.B depicts the density of LTV ratios on low documentation loans in the year 2004 for 620− and 620+ groups. Again,
a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test for equality of distribution functions
cannot be rejected at the 1% level. The fact that we find that the
borrowers characteristics are similar around the threshold (Section IV.C) also confirms that selection based on observables is
unlikely to explain our results.20
Second, there might be concerns about selection of loans by
investors. In particular, our results could be explained if investors
could potentially cherry pick better loans below the threshold.
The loan and borrower variables in our data are identical to the
data upon which investors base their decisions (Kornfeld 2007).
Furthermore, as shown in Section IV.C, these variables are smooth
through the threshold, mitigating any concerns on selection by
investors.21
Finally, strategic adverse selection on the part of lenders may
also be a concern. Lenders could, for instance, keep loans of better
quality on their balance sheet and offer only loans of worse quality to the investors. This concern is mitigated for several reasons.
20. The equality of interest rate distributions also rules out differences in the
expected cost of capital across the threshold as an alternative explanation. For
instance, lenders could originate riskier loans above the threshold only because
the expected cost of capital was lower due to easier securitization. However, in
a competitive market, the interest rates charged for these loans should reflect
the riskiness of the borrowers. In that case, as mean interest rates above and
below the threshold would be the same (Section IV.C), lenders must have added
riskier borrowers above the threshold—resulting in a more dispersed interest rate
distribution above the threshold. Our analysis in Figure IX.A shows that this is
not the case.
21. An argument might also be made that banks screen similarly around
the credit threshold but are able to sell portfolios of loans above and below the
threshold to investors with different risk tolerance. If this were the case, it could
potentially explain our results in Section IV.D. This does not seem likely. Because
all the loans in our sample are securitized, our results on performance on loans
around the credit threshold are conditional on securitization. Moreover, securitized
loans are sold to investors in pools that contain a mix of loans from the entire credit
score spectrum. As a result, it is difficult to argue that loans of 620− are purchased
by different investors as compared to loans of 620+ .

similar for both the groups. A Kolmogorov–Smirnov test for equality of distribution
functions cannot be rejected at the 1% level. Data for loans originated in 2004 are
reported here. We find similar patterns for 2001–2006 originations. We do not

DID SECURITIZATION LEAD TO LAX SCREENING?

QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

First, the securitization guidelines suggest that lenders offer the
entire pool of loans to investors and that conditional on observables, SPVs largely follow a randomized selection rule to create
bundles of loans. This suggests that securitized loans would look
similar to those that remain on the balance sheet (Comptroller’s
Handbook 1997; Gorton and Souleles 2006).22 In addition, this
selection, if at all present, will tend to be more severe below the
credit threshold, thereby biasing us against finding any effect of
screening on performance.
We conduct an additional test that also suggests that our results are not driven by selection on the part of lenders. Although
banks may screen and then strategically hold loans on their balance sheets, independent lenders do not keep a portfolio of loans
on their books. These lenders finance their operations entirely
out of short-term warehouse lines of credit, have limited equity
capital, and have no deposit base to absorb losses on loans that
they originate (Gramlich 2007). Consequently, they have limited
motives for strategically choosing which loans to sell to investors.
However, because loans below the threshold are more difficult to
securitize and thus are less liquid, these independent lenders still
have strong incentives to differentially screen these loans to avoid
losses. We focus on these lenders to isolate the effects of screening
in our results on defaults (Section IV.D).
To test this, we classify the lenders into two categories—banks
(banks, subsidiaries, thrifts) and independents—and examine the
performance results only for the sample of loans originated by
independent lenders. It is difficult to identify all the lenders in
the database because many of the lender names are abbreviated. In order to ensure that we are able to cover a majority
of our sample, we classify the top fifty lenders (by origination volume) across the years in our sample period, based on
a list from the publication “Inside B&C Mortgage.” In unreported results, we confirm that independent lenders also follow the rule of thumb for low-documentation loans. Moreover,
low-documentation loans securitized by independents with credit
scores of 620− are about 15% less likely to default after a year as
22. We confirmed this fact by examining a subset of loans held on the lenders’
balance sheets. The alternative data set covers the top ten servicers in the subprime market (more than 60% of the market) with details on performance and loan
terms of loans that are securitized or held on the lenders’ balance sheet. We find
no differences in the performance of loans that are securitized relative to those
kept by lenders, around the 620 threshold. Results of this analysis are available
upon request.

compared to low-documentation loans securitized by them with
credit scores 620+ .23 Note that the results in the sample of loans
originated by lenders without a strategic selling motive are similar in magnitude to those in the overall sample (which includes
other lenders that screen and then may strategically sell). This
finding highlights that screening is the driving force behind our
results.
IV.F. Additional Variation from a Natural Experiment
Unrelated Optimal Rule of Thumb. So far we have worked
under the assumption that the 620 threshold is related to securitization. One could plausibly argue, in the spirit of Baumol and
Quandt (1964), that this rule of thumb could have been set by
lenders as an optimal cutoff for screening that was unrelated to
differential securitization. Ruling this alternative out requires an
examination of the effects of the threshold when the ease of securitization varies, everything else equal. To achieve this, we exploit
a natural experiment that involves the passage of anti–predatory
lending laws in two states which reduced securitization in the
subprime market drastically. Subsequent to protests by market
participants, the laws were substantially amended and the securitization market reverted to prelaw levels. We use these laws to
examine how the main effects vary with the time series variation
in the ease of securitization likelihood around the threshold in the
two states.
In October 2002, the Georgia Fair Lending Act (GFLA) went
into effect, imposing anti–predatory lending restrictions that at
the time were considered the toughest in the United States. The
law allowed unlimited punitive damages when lenders did not
comply with the provisions, and that liability extended to holders in due course. Once GFLA was enacted, the market response
was swift. Fitch, Moody’s, and S&P were reluctant to rate securitized pools that included Georgia loans. In effect, the demand for
the securitization of mortgage loans from Georgia fell drastically
during the same period. In response to these actions, the Georgia
legislature amended the GLFA in early 2003. The amendments
removed many of the GFLAs ambiguities and eliminated covered
loans. Subsequent to April 2003, the market revived in Georgia.
23. More specifically, in a specification similar to column (2) in Panel C of
Table III, we find that the coefficient on the indicator T(FICO ≥ 620) is 0.67 (t =
3.21).

QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

Similarly, New Jersey enacted its law, the New Jersey Homeownership Security Act of 2002, with many provisions similar to those
of the Georgia law. As in Georgia, lenders and ratings agencies
expressed concerns when the New Jersey law was passed and decided to substantially reduce the number of loans that were securitized in these markets. The Act was later amended in June 2004
in a way that relaxed requirements and eased lenders’ concerns.
If lenders use 620 as an optimal cutoff for screening unrelated to securitization, we expect the passage of these laws to
have no effect on the differential screening standards around the
threshold. However, if these laws affect the differential ease of
securitization around the threshold, our hypothesis would predict
an impact on the screening standards. As 620+ loans became relatively more difficult to securitize, lenders would internalize the
cost of collecting soft information for these loans to a greater degree. Consequently, the screening differentials we observed earlier
should attenuate during the period of enforcement. Moreover, we
expect the results described in Section IV.D to appear only during
the periods when the differential ease of securitization around the
threshold was high, that is, before the law was passed and after
the law was amended.
Our experimental design examines the ease of securitization
and performance of loans above and below the credit threshold in
both Georgia and New Jersey during the period when the securitization market was affected and compares it with the period before
the law was passed and the period after the law was amended. To
do so, we estimate equations (1) and (2) with an additional dummy
variable that captures whether or not the law is in effect (NoLaw).
We also include time fixed effects to control for any macroeconomic
factors independent of the laws.
The results are striking. Panel A of Table IV confirms that
the discontinuity in the number of loans around the threshold diminishes during a period of strict enforcement of anti–predatory
lending laws. In particular, the difference in number of loans securitized around the credit thresholds fell by around 95% during the
period when the law was passed in Georgia and New Jersey. This
effectively nullified any meaningful difference in the ease of securitization above the FICO threshold. Another intuitive way to see
this is to compare these jumps in the number of loans with jumps
in states that had housing profiles similar to those of Georgia and
New Jersey before the law was passed (e.g., Texas in 2001). For
instance, relative to the discontinuity in Texas, the jump during

Notes. This table reports estimates of the regressions on differences in number of loans and performance
of loans across the credit thresholds. We use specifications similar to these Table II, Panel A, to estimate
the number of loans regressions and Table III, Panel C, to estimate delinquency regressions. We restrict
our analysis to loans made in Georgia and New Jersey. NoLaw is a dummy that takes a value of 1 if the
anti–predatory lending law was not passed in a given year or was amended and a value of 0 during the time
period when the law was passed. Permutation tests confirm that the discontinuity in number of loans at 620
when the law is not passed has the smallest p-value (and is thus the largest outlier) in the Georgia and New
Jersey sample. We report t-statistics in parentheses (marginal effects are reported in square brackets).

the period when the law was passed is about 5%, whereas the
jumps are of comparable size both before the law was passed and
after the law was amended. In addition, the results also indicate
the rapid return of a discontinuity after the law is revoked. It
is notable that this time horizon is too brief for any meaningful
change in the housing stock (Glaeser and Gyourko 2005) or in the
underlying demand for home ownership.
Importantly, our performance results follow the same pattern
as well. Columns (1) and (2) of Panel B show that the default rates
for 620+ loans were below that of 620− loans in both Georgia and
New Jersey only when the law was in effect. In addition, when the

law was either not passed or was amended, we find that default
rates for loans above the credit threshold are similar to those for
loans below the credit threshold. This upward shift in the default
curve above the 620 threshold is consistent with the results reported in Section IV.D. Taken together, these results suggest that
our findings are indeed related to differential securitization at the
credit threshold and that lenders were not blindly following the
rule of thumb in all instances.
Manipulation of Credit Scores. Having confirmed that
lenders are screening more at 620− than at 620+ , we assess
whether borrowers were aware of the differential screening
around the threshold. Even though there is no difference in contract terms around the cutoff, screening is weaker above the 620
score than below it, and this may create an incentive for borrowers
to manipulate their credit score. If FICO scores could be manipulated, lower quality borrowers might artificially appear at higher
credit scores. This behavior would be consistent with our central
claim of differential screening around the threshold. Note that
per the rating agency (Fair Isaac), it is difficult to strategically
manipulate one’s FICO score in a targeted manner. Nevertheless,
to examine the response of borrowers more closely, we exploit the
variation generated from the same natural experiment.
If FICO scores tend to be quite sticky and it takes relatively
long periods of time (more than three to six months) to improve
credit scores, as Fair Isaac claims, we should observe that the
difference in performance around the threshold should take time
to appear after the laws are reversed. Restricting our analysis to
loans originated within six months after the laws were reversed,
columns (3) and (4) of Panel B (Table IV) show that the reversal
of anti–predatory lending laws has immediate effects on the performance of loans that are securitized. This result suggests that
borrowers might not have been aware of the differential screening
around the threshold or were unable to quickly manipulate their
FICO scores. Overall, the evidence in this section is consistent
with Mayer and Pence (2008), who find no evidence of manipulation of FICO scores in their survey of the subprime market.24
24. As a further check, we obtained another data set of subprime loans that
continues to track the FICO scores of borrowers after loan origination. Borrowers
who manipulate their FICO scores before loan issuance should experience a decline
in FICO score shortly after receiving a loan (because a permanent change in the
credit score cannot be considered manipulation). Consistent with evidence for no

IV.G. Additional Confirmatory Tests
GSE Selection. Although the subprime market is dominated
by the nonagency sector, one might worry that the GSEs may differentially influence the selection of borrowers into the subprime
market through their actions in the prime market. For instance,
the very best borrowers above the 620 threshold might select out
of the subprime market in search of better terms in the prime
market. We establish several facts to confirm that this is not the
case.
First, the natural experiment we discuss in Section IV.F
suggests that prime-influenced selection is not at play. The
anti–predatory lending laws were targeted primarily toward the
subprime part of the market (Bostic et al. 2008), leaving
the prime part of the market relatively unaffected. To confirm
the behavior of the prime market during the enforcement of anti–
predatory lending laws, we rely on another data set of mortgages
in the United States that covers the agency loan market. The data
are collected from the top U.S. servicers, are primarily focused on
the agency market, and covers the period 2001 to 2006. As reported in Panel A of Table V, during the natural experiment, it
was no more difficult to obtain an agency loan (comparable to a
subprime loan in our sample) than before or after the law was
in effect. Similarly, in unreported tests we find that contractual
terms (such as LTV ratios and interest rates) around 620 see no
change across time periods. Furthermore, in the prime market,
there were no differences in defaults around the 620 threshold
across the time periods (Table V, Panel B). Because borrower quality in the prime market did not change across the 620 threshold
across the two time periods, if there was indeed selection, the very
best 620+ subprime borrowers should have selected out into the
prime market even while the laws were in place. As a result, we
should have found that 620+ borrowers in subprime market continued to default more than 620− borrowers even when the law is
in place. As we showed earlier in Table IV, this is not the case.
Second, the data set confirms that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae primarily do not buy subprime loans (especially lowdocumentation loans) with credit scores around FICO of 620.
This is consistent with anecdotal evidence that the role of active
manipulation around the threshold, we find that both 620+ and 620− borrowers
are as likely to experience such a reduction within a quarter of obtaining a loan.
Results of this analysis are available upon request.

Notes. This table reports estimates of the regressions on differences in number of loans and performance
of loans across the credit thresholds. The analysis is restricted to prime loans made in Georgia and New Jersey.
The data are for GSE loans that are first mortgages, that are either single-family or condo or a townhouse, that
are only purchase loans, that are conventional mortgages without private insurance, and that are primary
residents for the borrower. NoLaw is a dummy that takes a value 1 if the anti–predatory lending law was
not passed in a given year or was amended and a value 0 during the time period when the law was passed.
Permutation tests confirm that the discontinuity in number of loans at 620 when the law is not passed or
passed is no different from estimated jumps at other locations in the distribution in the Georgia and New
Jersey sample. We report t-statistics in parentheses (marginal effects are reported in square brackets).

subprime securitization in recent years had shifted to the nonagency sector (Gramlich 2007). In unreported permutation tests
(see Online Appendix Table 4, Panel A), we also find a very small
jump in the number of loans in the agency market across the
620 threshold. In addition, the loan terms and default rates are
also smooth. Together these results suggest that, in general, there
seems to be no differential selection in terms of number of loans
or quality of loans across the 620 cutoff.
Third, if our results in the low-documentation market around
the 620 threshold are driven by differential GSE selection, we

should observe no differences in defaults when we combined
the loans from agencies with low-documentation subprime loans
around the 620 threshold. If it were purely selection, lower performance above the threshold in the low-documentation subprime
loans would be offset by differentially higher quality loans selected
into the agency market. Unreported results (Online Appendix Table 5) show that there are still differences in default rates across
the 620 threshold when we examine the agency loans and lowdocumentation subprime loans together.
Finally, we examine the set of borrowers in the subprime
market (around 620) who are offered contractual terms similar
to those offered in the prime market. If there is indeed selection
into the prime market, it is likely based on contractual terms
offered to borrowers. By examining borrowers who are offered
similar contractual terms in the subprime market, we are able to
isolate our analysis to borrowers of similar quality as those who
are possibly attracted by GSEs (i.e., the good-quality borrowers).
For this subset of subprime borrowers, we are able to show that
620+ loans still default more than 620− loans (Online Appendix
Table 4, Panel B). This evidence further suggests that selection
by GSEs is unlikely to explain our results.
Other Thresholds. In the data, we also observe smaller jumps
in other parts of the securitized loan FICO distribution as other ad
hoc cutoffs have appeared in the market in the past three years
(e.g., 600 for low documentation in 2005 and 2006). We remain
agnostic as to why or how these other cutoffs have appeared: due
to greater willingness to lend to riskier borrowers, or to changing
use of automated underwriting, which generally included a matrix
of qualifications and loan terms including FICO buckets. Several
comments about why we focus on the 620 threshold are therefore
in order.
First, the 620 cutoff is the only threshold that is actively
discussed by the GSEs in their lending guidelines, where the ease
of securitization is higher on the right side of the threshold (see
Online Appendix Exhibit 1). This feature is essential for us to
disentangle the effect of lax screening on defaults from what a
change in FICO score might predict. As increasing FICO scores
predict decreasing default rates, performing our analysis with
any cutoff where ease of securitization is lower on the right side
of the threshold would not allow us to use this identification. For
instance, consider the cutoff of 660 that is also discussed in the

DID SECURITIZATION LEAD TO LAX SCREENING?

QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

GSE guidelines and where we observe a jump in securitization.
The ease of securitization is lower on the right-hand side of this
cutoff; that is, the unconditional probability of securitization is
lower at 660+ relative to 660− , suggesting that 660+ loans would
be more intensively screened and would default less frequently
than 660− . However, it would be impossible to disentangle this
effect from just a mechanical effect of 660+ FICO loans being more
creditworthy and thus defaulting less often than 660− loans (by
construction). This subtle advantage of the 620 cutoff is crucial to
our identification strategy and rules out the use of several other
ad hoc thresholds. In general, our methodology could extend to
any cutoff that had greater ease of securitization on the right side
of the threshold.
Moreover, to identify the effects of securitization on screening by lenders, the liquidity differential for the loan portfolios
around the threshold has to be large enough. Because 620 is the
largest jump we observe in the loan distribution, it is a natural
choice. This is confirmed in the permutation tests, which show
that FICO = 620 has the smallest p-value (and is thus the largest
outlier) among all the visible discontinuities for each year in our
sample. Although other cutoffs may also induce slight differences
in screening effort in some years, these differences may be too
small to make any meaningful inferences. In results not shown,
we analyzed some of these other thresholds and found results for
delinquencies that are consistent with those reported for the predominant cutoff (620), but are indeed quite small in magnitude.
Other Tests. We also conduct several falsification tests, repeating our analysis at other credit scores where there is no jump
in securitization. In sharp contrast to the results reported in Section IV.D, the higher credit score bucket defaults less than the
lower credit score bucket. This is consistent with the results of
the permutation tests reported above, which estimate every false
discontinuity and compare it to the discontinuity at 620. Moreover,
as we will show in Section V, full-documentation loans do not see
any jumps at this threshold. We plot the delinquency rates of 620+
and 620− for full-documentation loans (2001–2006) in Figure X
and find that loans made at lower credit scores are more likely to
default.25
25. This test can also provide insight into the issue of GSE selection discussed earlier. Because 620+ full documentation loans do not default more than
−
620 loans, differential selection into the agency market must account for this

Falsification Test—Delinquencies for Full-Documentation Loans
around FICO of 620
The figure presents the falsification test by examining the percentage of fulldocumentation loans (dollar-weighted) originated between 2001 and 2006 that
became delinquent. We track loans in two FICO buckets—615–619 (620− ) dashed
and 620–624 (620+ ) solid—from their origination date and plot the average loans
that become delinquent each month after the origination date. As can be seen,
the higher credit score bucket defaults less than the lower credit score bucket for
the post-2000 period. For brevity, we do not report plots separately for each year
of origination. The effects shown here in the pooled 2001–2006 plot show up for
every year.

As further tests of our hypothesis, we also conducted our tests
in the refinance market, and find a similar rule of thumb and
similar default outcomes around the 620 threshold in this market. Finally, we reestimated our specifications with state, lender,
and pool fixed effects to account for multiple levels of potential
variation in the housing market and find qualitatively similar
results.26
fact as well. One possibility is selection on the basis of debt-to-income ratios. To
examine this, we compare DTI ratios in the full- and low-documentation markets.
Unreported tests (Online Appendix Table 3) show that the DTI ratios are similar
around the threshold and thus cannot entirely explain results across the two types
of loans.

V. DID HARD INFORMATION MATTER?
The results presented above are for low-documentation loans,
which necessarily have an unobserved component of borrowers’
creditworthiness. In the full-documentation loan market, on the
other hand, there is no omission of hard information on the borrower’s ability to repay. In this market, we identify a credit threshold at the FICO score of 600, the score that Fair Isaac (and the
three credit repositories) advises lenders as a bottom cutoff for
low risk borrowers. They note that “anything below 600 is considered someone who probably has credit problems that need to be
addressed...” (see www.myfico.com). Similarly, Fannie Mae in its
guidelines notes that “a borrower with credit score of 600 or less
has a high primary risk...” (see www.allregs.com/efnma/doc/). The
Consumer Federation of America along with Fair Isaac (survey report in March 2005) suggests that “FICO credit scores range from
300–850, and a score above 700 indicates relatively low credit
risk, while scores below 600 indicate relatively high risk which
could make it harder to get credit or lead to higher loan rates.”
Einav, Jenkins and Levin (2008) make a similar observation when
they note that “a FICO score above 600 [is] a typical cut-off for
obtaining a standard bank loan.”
Figure XI reveals that there is a substantial increase in the
number of full documentation loans above the credit threshold
of 600. This pattern is consistent with the notion that lenders
are more willing to securitize at a lower credit threshold (600 vs.
620) for full-documentation loans because there is less uncertainty
about these borrowers relative to those who provide less documentation. The magnitudes are again large—around 100% higher at
600+ than at 600− in 2004—for full-documentation loans. In Panel
A of Table VI, we estimate regressions similar to equation (1) and
find that the coefficient estimate is also significant at 1% and is
on average around 100% (from 80% to 141%) higher for 600+ as
compared to 600− for post-2000 loans. Again, if the underlying
creditworthiness and the demand for mortgage loans (at a given
price) are the same for potential buyers with a credit score of 600−
or 600+ , as the credit bureaus claim, this result confirms that it is
easier to securitize full-documentation loans above the 600 FICO
threshold. We repeated a similar analysis for loan characteristics (LTV and interest rates) and borrower demographics and find
no differences for full documentation loans above and below the
credit score of 600. Appendix I.C presents the estimates from the

’00s). We plot the average number of loans at each FICO score between 500 and
800. As can be seen from the graphs, there is a large increase in number of loans
around the 600 credit threshold (i.e., more loans at 600+ as compared to 600− )
from 2001 onward. Data are for loans originated between 2001 and 2006.

regressions (Appendix I.D provides permutation test estimates
corresponding to these loan terms).
Interestingly, we find that full-documentation loans with
credit scores of 600− (FICO between 595 and 599) are about
as likely to default after a year as loans with credit scores of
600+ (FICO between 601 and 605) for the post-2000 period.
Both Figures XII and XIII and results in Panels B, C, and D of
Table VI support this conjecture. Following the methodology used
in Figures VI and VII, we show the default rates annually across
the FICO distribution (Figure XII) and across the age of the loans
(Figure XIII). The estimated effects of the ad hoc rule on defaults
are negligible in all specifications.
The absence of differences in default rates across the credit
threshold, while the same magnitude of the jump in the number of
loans is maintained, is consistent with the notion that the pattern
of delinquencies around the low-documentation threshold are primarily due to the soft information of the borrower. With so much

Notes. This table reports estimates of the regressions on differences in number of loans and performance
of loans around the credit threshold of 600 for full-documentation loans. We use specifications similar to
these in Table II, Panel A, to estimate the number of loan regressions and Table III, Panels A, B, and C, to
estimate delinquency regressions. Permutation tests confirm that FICO = 600 has the smallest permutation
test p-value (and is thus the largest outlier) among all the visible discontinuities in the full-documentation
loan sample. We report t-statistics in parentheses (marginal effects are reported in square brackets).

FIGURE XII
Annual Delinquencies for Full-Documentation Loans
The figure presents the percentage of full-documentation loans originated between 2001 and 2006 that became delinquent. We plot the dollar-weighted fraction
of the pool that becomes delinquent for one-point FICO bins between scores of 500
and 750. The vertical line denotes the 600 cutoff, and a seventh-order polynomial
is fitted to the data on either side of the threshold. Delinquencies are reported
between 10 and 15 months for loans originated in all years.

information collected by the lender for full-documentation loans,
there is less value to collecting soft information. Consequently, for
full-documentation loans there is no difference in how the loans
perform subsequently after hard information has been controlled
for. Put another way, differences in returns to screening are attenuated due to the presence of more hard information.
VI. DISCUSSION
In the wake of the subprime mortgage crisis, a central
question confronting market participants and policy makers is
whether securitization had an adverse effect on the ex ante screening effort of loan originators. Comparing characteristics of the loan
market above and below the ad hoc credit threshold, we show
that a doubling of securitization volume is on average associated
with about a 10%–25% increase in defaults. Notably, our empirical
strategy delivers only inferences on differences in the performance

FIGURE XIII
Delinquencies for Full-Documentation Loans (2001–2006)
The figure presents the percentage of full-documentation loans (dollarweighted) originated between 2001 and 2006 that became delinquent. We track
loans in two FICO buckets—595–599 (600− ) dashed and 600–604 (600+ ) solid—
from their origination date and plot the average loans that become delinquent each
month after the origination date. As can be seen, the higher credit score bucket
defaults more than the lower credit score bucket for the post-2000 period. For
brevity, we do not report plots separately for each year of origination. The effects
shown here in the pooled 2001–2006 plot show up for every year.

of loans around this threshold. Although we cannot infer what the
optimal level of screening at each credit score ought to be, we conclude from our empirical analysis that there was a causal link
between ease of securitization and screening. That we find any effect on default behavior in one portfolio compared to another with
virtually identical risk profiles, demographic characteristics, and
loan terms suggests that the ease of securitization may have had
a direct impact on incentives elsewhere in the subprime housing
market. Understanding whether the ease of securitization had
a similar impact on other securitized markets requires more research.
The results of this paper, in particular from the anti–
predatory lending laws’ natural experiment, confirm that lender
behavior in the subprime market did change based on the ease
of securitization. This suggests that existing securitization practices did not ensure that a decline in screening standards would be
counteracted by requiring originators to hold more of the loans’
default risk. If lenders were in fact holding on to optimal risk

where it was easier to securitize, there should have been no differences in defaults around the threshold. This finding resonates
well with concerns surrounding the subprime crisis that, in an
environment with limited disclosure on who holds what in the
originate-to-distribute chain, there may have been insufficient
“skin in the game” for some lenders (Blinder 2007; Stiglitz 2007).
At the same time, the results further suggest that the breakdown
in the process only occurred for loans where soft information was
particulary important. With enough hard information, as in the
full-documentation market, there may be less value in requiring
market participants to hold additional risk to counteract the potential moral hazard of reduced screening standards.
In a market as competitive as the market for mortgagebacked securities, our results on interest rates are puzzling.
Lenders’ compensation on either side of the threshold should
reflect differences in default rates, and yet we find that the
interest rates to borrowers are similar on either side of 620. The
difference in defaults, despite similar compensation around the
threshold, suggests that there may have been some efficiency
losses. Of course, it is possible that from the lenders’ perspective,
a higher propensity to default above the threshold could have
exactly offset the benefits of additional liquidity—resulting in
identical interest rates around the threshold.
Our analysis remains agnostic about whether investors
priced the moral hazard aspects of securitization accurately. It
may have been the case that moral hazard existed in this market,
though investors appropriately priced persistent differences in
performance around the threshold (see Rajan, Seru, and Vig
[2008]). On the other hand, developing an arbitrage strategy for
exploiting this opportunity may have been prohibitively difficult,
given that loans are pooled across the FICO spectrum before they
are traded. In addition, these fine differences in performance
around the FICO threshold could have been obscured by the
performance of other complex loan products in the pool. Understanding these aspects of investor behavior warrants additional
investigation.
It is important to note that we refrain from making any welfare claims. Our conclusions should be directed at securitization
practices, as they were during the subprime boom, rather than at
the optimally designed originate-to-distribute model. We believe
securitization is an important innovation and has several merits.
It is often asserted that securitization improves the efficiency of
credit markets. The underlying assumption behind this assertion

QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

is that there is no information loss in transmission, even though
securitization increases the distance between borrowers and investors. The benefits of securitization are limited by information
loss, and in particular the costs we document in the paper. More
generally, what types of credit products should be securitized? We
conjecture that the answer depends crucially on the information
structure: loans with more hard information are likely to benefit
from securitization relative to loans that involve soft information.
A careful investigation of this question is a promising area for
future research.
More broadly, our findings caution against policy that emphasizes excessive reliance on default models. Our research suggests
that by relying entirely on hard information variables such as
FICO scores, these models ignore essential elements of strategic behavior on the part of lenders which are likely to be important. The formation of a rule of thumb, even if optimal (Baumol
and Quandt 1964), has an undesirable effect on the incentives of
lenders to collect and process soft information. As in Lucas (1976),
this strategic behavior can alter the relationship between observable borrower characteristics and default likelihood, rather than
moving along the previous predicted relationship. Incorporating
these strategic elements into default models, although challenging, is another important direction for future research.

Notes. This table reports estimates from a regression that uses the mean interest rate and LTV ratio of
low-documentation loans at each FICO score as the dependent variables. In order to estimate the discontinuity
(FICO ≥ 620) for each year, we collapse the interest rate and LTV ratio at each FICO score and estimate flexible
seventh-order polynomials on either side of the 620 cutoff, allowing for a discontinuity at 620. Because the
measures of the interest rate and LTV are estimated means, we weight each observation by the inverse
of the variance of the estimate. We report t-statistics in parentheses. Permutation tests, which allow for a
discontinuity at every point in the FICO distribution, confirm that these jumps are not significantly larger
than those found elsewhere in the distribution. For brevity, we report permutation test estimates from pooled
regressions (with time fixed effects removed to account for vintage effects) and report them in Appendix I.D.

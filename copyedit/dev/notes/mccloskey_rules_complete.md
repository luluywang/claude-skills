# McCloskey's Complete Rules and Craft Principles
## A Systematic Documentation of "Economical Writing" (2nd Edition, 2000)

> "The one genuine rule, a golden one, is **Be Clear**" — Deirdre McCloskey

---

## Overview

This document systematically documents all the rules, principles, and craft advice from Deirdre McCloskey's *Economical Writing*. McCloskey's fundamental message: **Economics is too fine a subject to be left in a verbal mess out of mere laziness.**

The book operates on multiple levels:
- **Psychological** (overcome fear, develop taste, achieve flow)
- **Social** (reader as sovereign, writing as conversation)
- **Technical** (specific rules about sentences, words, punctuation)
- **Philosophical** (writing as thinking, rhetoric as the art of warranted belief)

## The Cardinal Rule

### **BE CLEAR**

"The one genuine rule, a golden one, is Be Clear."

From Quintilian (1st century AD): "Write not merely so that the reader can understand but so that he cannot possibly misunderstand."

**Clarity is a social matter**, not something to be decided unilaterally by the writer. As Karl Popper said: "If a conscientious reader finds a passage unclear, it has to be re-written."

**The reader, like the consumer, is sovereign.**

---

## McCloskey's Named Rules

### 1. **The First Rule**
"Many of the rules we learned in Miss Jones' class in the eighth grade are wrong."

The bad rules from eighth grade have nearly ruined economic prose. See "Miss Jones' Bad Rules" section below.

### 2. **The Rule of Coherence**
"Make writing hang together."

The reader can understand writing that hangs together, from phrases up to entire books. Coherence is achieved through:
- Repeating key words (not "elegant variation")
- Parallel structure for parallel ideas
- Clear connections between sentences
- Consistent terminology

### 3. **Gardner's Rule**
"Do not complicate more than one of the triad: subject, verb, object."

Choose only ONE of the three parts of a sentence for elaboration. If you complicate the subject, keep verb and object simple. If you need a complex verb phrase, simplify subject and object.

**Bad:** "The consideration by the Council of the question of compensation for victims of crimes using the methodology of cost-benefit analysis was completed in March."

**Good:** "In March the Council completed its consideration of compensating crime victims, using cost-benefit analysis."

### 4. **The Rule of Arrangement**
"The end of the sentence is the place of emphasis."

- Put important matters at the **end**
- Put less important matters at the **beginning**
- Dump trivial matters in the **middle** (or trash)

**Example:**
- Weak: "The economy grew in 1929, though only at 2 percent."
- Strong: "The economy grew in 1929, though only by 2 percent."
- Stronger: "Though the economy grew in 1929, it grew only by 2 percent."

### 5. **The Read-Aloud Rule**
"Don't write anything that you would be embarrassed to read out loud to the intended audience."

**Test:** Imagine reading your paper aloud to your Implied Reader (Richard Sutch, Professor Smith, your friend down the hall). If it embarrasses you, it's embarrassing. Fix it.

### 6. **Sydney Smith's Rule**
"Run your pen through every other word you have written; you have no idea what vigour it will give to your style."

Cut ruthlessly. Every word that doesn't work is a word too many.

### 7. **Fowler's Rule: Avoid Elegant Variation**
"Use one word to mean one thing consistently."

**Bad:** "The price rose. The increase in value reflected supply shifts. The elevation of the quotation..."

**Good:** "The price rose. The price increase reflected supply shifts. The higher price..."

Don't fear repeating important words. Repetition creates coherence. "Elegant variation" creates confusion.

### 8. **Strunk and White's Rule**
"Express parallel ideas in parallel form."

**Bad:** "The study examines prices, investigates quantities, and demand elasticities are estimated."

**Good:** "The study examines prices, investigates quantities, and estimates demand elasticities."

### 9. **Do Not Overuse Commas**
Use punctuation by ear, not by rule.

Most writers use too many commas, especially before "the":
- Not: "The increase in, the price caused..."
- But: "The increase in the price caused..."

Read aloud to test punctuation.

### 10. **Query Every "This"**
Take most of them out.

**Bad:** "This shows that demand is elastic."

**Better:** "The evidence shows that demand is elastic."

Or repeat the noun: "This elasticity implies..."

## Miss Jones' Bad Rules (TO REJECT)

These are the **wrong** rules from eighth-grade English class that have "nearly ruined economic prose":

### 1. **THE JONESIAN RULE OF ARRANGEMENT (THE WORST)**
"Say what you're going to say; say it; say that you've said it."

This rule has nearly ruined economic prose with endless:
- Summaries before you've said anything
- Outlines and anticipations
- Announcements of what's coming
- Redundancy and repetition
- Reviews of what you've already said

**McCloskey's verdict:** "The person who made up this memorable phrasing is burning right now in Hell."

**Better approach:** Just say it once, clearly.

### 2. **Never Repeat the Same Word Within Three Lines**
**WRONG.** You MUST repeat words to achieve coherence.

"Elegant variation" (using synonyms to avoid repetition) creates confusion. Use one word to mean one thing consistently.

### 3. **Never Write "I"**
Senseless if it just results in replacing "I" with "we" or "the author."

Use "I" when appropriate. Don't hide behind pompous constructions.

### 4. **Don't Be Common; Write Fancy**
**WRONG.** Be plain instead.

Use Anglo-Saxon words over Latin/Greek pomposity:
- Not "utilize" but "use"
- Not "commence" but "begin"
- Not "purchase" but "buy"

### 5. **Never Split Infinitives**
H.W. Fowler demolished this rule in 1926.

"To really understand" is fine. "To boldly go" is fine. Don't contort sentences to avoid splits.

### 6. **Never End a Sentence with a Preposition**
Churchill demolished this: "This is the sort of impertinence up with which I will not put."

If the sentence sounds better with a final preposition, use it: "What did you step on?"

### 7. **Always Use Commas After If-Clauses**
No. Use your ear instead.

Not every "if" needs a comma. Read aloud to decide.

## Writing as Craft: Meta-Principles

### Writing Is a Skill, Not a Character Trait

"Amateur writers suppose that writing is a character trait instead of a skill."

**Key insights:**
- Writing is learned craft, like sewing or carpentry
- Professional writers take advantage of criticism
- "We all—you, I, and Dave Barry—can use more criticism"
- Anyone can improve with practice and attention
- Defending bad writing as "personal style" is amateurish

### Writing IS Thinking

"Don't wait until the research is done to begin writing because writing, to repeat, is a way of thinking."

**Practical implications:**
- Write early and continuously throughout research
- Writing clarifies muddy thinking
- Use "The File" system (C. Wright Mills):
  - Keep cards, notes, paragraphs
  - Constantly rearrange and recombine
  - Let writing guide research direction
- Writing is not transcription of completed thought—it IS thought

### Flow and Joy in Writing

Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's "flow": happiness when "a person's skills are fully involved in overcoming a challenge that is just about manageable."

**Achieving flow:**
- Writing is play once you learn the rules
- "It's great fun to get a sentence just right"
- Find the level where challenge meets skill
- Develop taste through reading good writing
- Take pleasure in craft

### The Social Nature of Writing

"Clarity is a social matter, not something to be decided unilaterally by the writer."

**Key principles:**
- The reader is sovereign
- Choose an Implied Reader (specific person)
- Choose an Implied Author (persona you adopt)
- Writing is conversation, not monologue
- "The Great Conversation" (Oakeshott): education as initiation into intellectual discourse

### Economics as Rhetoric

Writing involves three classical arts:
1. **Invention** (getting ideas through analogy, metaphor, thought)
2. **Arrangement** (structure, organization, order)
3. **Style** (clarity, grace, word choice)

All three matter. All three can be learned.

## Systematic Advice: The Details

### On Audience

**Choose an Implied Reader:**
- Make it specific: "Richard Sutch" or "Professor Smith" or "my friend down the hall"
- Not "the profession" (too vague)
- Someone smart but not omniscient
- Someone you respect and want to convince

**Choose an Implied Author:**
- Earnest Scientist
- Reasonable Journeyman
- Skilled Practitioner
- Not: Pompous Authority or Defensive Graduate Student

**Mix audiences carefully:**
- Don't rederive Cobb-Douglas production function in a translog paper (specialist audience doesn't need it)
- Don't use unexplained jargon with general audience
- "If it embarrasses you, imagining how Sutch would read it, the stuff is embarrassing: fix it"

### On Process

**Fluency First, Revision Later**
- "Easy writing makes hard reading" (Dr. Johnson)
- "Hard writing makes easy reading" (the corollary)
- Get words on page first, polish later
- Professional writers revise extensively (Hemingway rewrote the last page of *Farewell to Arms* sixty times—in pencil)

**Write Early Rather Than Late**
- Mix writing with research continuously
- Don't wait until research is "done"
- Writing reveals gaps in thinking and research

**Keep "The File"**
- C. Wright Mills' method
- Cards, notes, paragraphs constantly rearranged
- Everything you write goes in The File
- Constantly recombine and reshape

**Stop in the Middle**
- Stop in the middle of a sentence to make restarting easier (Piaget)
- Always write down what comes next before breaking
- Leave yourself breadcrumbs to continue

### On Boilerplate (Things to Avoid)

**1. Never Start with "This paper..."**
It bores the reader. Get to the substance.

**Bad:** "This paper examines the relationship between price and quantity."

**Better:** "Prices and quantities moved together in 1929-1933, contrary to demand theory."

**2. No Table-of-Contents Paragraphs**
"The person who made up this memorable phrasing is burning right now in Hell."

Don't write: "Section 2 reviews the literature. Section 3 presents the model. Section 4..."

Just write well-organized prose. Readers can find sections on their own.

**3. No "Background" Padding**
If it's not relevant, cut it. Don't pad with historical context that doesn't inform your analysis.

**4. No Routine Roadmaps**
Your prose should read well without traffic directions.

**Bad:** "Before presenting the results, I first discuss the methodology."

**Better:** Just discuss the methodology, then present results. The structure will be clear.

**5. No Excessive Introduction/Summarization**
Get to the point. Respect the reader's time.

**6. No Rederiving Well-Known Theory**
If you're writing for specialists, don't rederive basic results. It's boilerplate.

### On Sentences

**Use Active Verbs**
- Not "active verbs should be used"
- But "you should use active verbs"
- Not "It is recommended that..."
- But "I recommend..."

**Find the Action and Make It a Verb**
Avoid nominalization (turning verbs into nouns):

**Bad:** "Data reanalysis need exists" (verb → noun)
**Good:** "We must reanalyze our data" (verb restored)

**Bad:** "The computation of the coefficient was undertaken"
**Good:** "We computed the coefficient"

**Circle Every "Is"**
Replace with action verbs wherever possible.

**Bad:** "Unemployment is at a high level."
**Good:** "Unemployment has risen." Or: "Unemployment stands at 8%."

**Write Complete Sentences**
Sentence fragments create confusion unless used deliberately for effect.

**Vary Sentence Length**
Monotony kills paragraphs. Mix short, punchy sentences with longer, more complex ones.

**Put Lengthy Bits at the End**
Unless it conflicts with the emphasis rule. Long subjects are hard to process.

**Bad:** "The hypothesis that technological change drives long-run growth in developing economies with open capital markets is tested."

**Good:** "I test the hypothesis that technological change drives long-run growth in developing economies with open capital markets."

**Better:** "I test whether technological change drives long-run growth—focusing on developing economies with open capital markets."

### On Paragraphs

**Paragraphs Should Have Points**
- Each paragraph = one point
- First sentence often states the point (topic sentence)
- Other sentences develop, support, or illustrate
- Final sentence often provides transition or emphasis

**Vary Paragraph Length**
- Long paragraphs tire readers
- Too many short paragraphs feel choppy
- Mix lengths for rhythm

**Test Coherence**
Can you summarize each paragraph in one sentence? If not, split it or focus it.

### On Words

**Be Concrete**
Move down the ladder of abstraction:
- Pepperidge Farm bread (most concrete)
- bread
- widgets
- X (most abstract)

**Example:**
- Not: "The magnitude of the effect was substantial"
- But: "The effect was large" (better)
- But: "The effect was 40 percent" (best)

**Be Plain**
Use Anglo-Saxon words over Latin/Greek pomposity:

| Don't Write | Write Instead |
|-------------|---------------|
| utilize | use |
| commence | begin |
| purchase | buy |
| finalize | finish |
| prioritize | rank |
| hypothesize | guess, conjecture |
| implement | carry out, do |
| methodology | method |
| time frame | time |

**Use Nouns and Verbs, Not Adjectives and Adverbs**
Delete adjectives first in revision.

**Bad:** "The extremely important and very significant result clearly shows..."
**Good:** "The result shows..."

**Avoid Teutonisms**
German-style noun piling:

**Bad:** "Private wealth-seeking activity"
**Good:** "Seeking wealth privately"
**Better:** "Seeking wealth"

**Untie German-Style Noun Knots**
Use "of" liberally to clarify:

**Bad:** "Capital labor ratio impact estimation"
**Good:** "Estimating the impact of the capital-labor ratio"

### On Punctuation

**Use Punctuation by Ear, Not by Rule**

**Colon (:)** = "to be specific"
- Introduces illustration or specification
- "The data show one thing: prices fell."

**Semicolon (;)** = "furthermore"
- Connects parallel remarks
- Or acts as super-comma in complex lists
- "Prices fell; quantities rose."

**Comma (,)** = brief pause
- Use by ear (read aloud)
- Avoid overuse
- Test: does it help clarity or hurt it?

**Delete Most Commas Before "The"**
- Not: "The increase in, the price"
- But: "The increase in the price"

**Avoid Comma Splices**
Grade-school error:

**Wrong:** "Prices fell, quantities rose."
**Right:** "Prices fell; quantities rose."
Or: "Prices fell. Quantities rose."
Or: "Prices fell, and quantities rose."

**Test by Reading Aloud**
Your ear will catch most errors.

### On Typography

**Avoid Acronyms**
"LQWAGE and BBLUUBB" baffle readers.

First use: spell out with acronym in parentheses
- "Gross Domestic Product (GDP)"
- Then use GDP

But if acronym appears only 2-3 times, just spell it out each time.

**Don't Justify (Align Right Margin)**
Use ragged right for academic writing. Easier to read.

**Use Italics/Quotes Sparingly**
If you need them for emphasis, the sentence is badly organized.

**Don't Use Scare Quotes**
Don't "apologize" for the "wrong" word.

Either use the word confidently or choose a different word.

## Bad Words to Avoid

McCloskey provides an extensive list of words that bad writers love:

### The Worst Offenders

**"Via"** - Usually unnecessary
- Not: "Growth occurs via investment"
- But: "Growth occurs through investment"

**"Process of"** - Strike it

- Use: "finish," "complete"

**"Former/Latter"** - Makes reader look back
- Repeat the nouns instead

**"Very"** - Weak intensifier
- "Think very hard before using 'very' very much"
- Use stronger verbs instead: "very big" → "huge"

## Mark Twain's 7 Rules

McCloskey cites Mark Twain's seven rules for good writing (from "Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offenses"):

1. **Say what he is proposing to say, not merely come near it**
2. **Use the right word, not its second cousin**
3. **Eschew surplusage** (cut unnecessary words)
4. **Not omit necessary details**
5. **Avoid slovenliness of form**
6. **Use good grammar**
7. **Employ a simple and straightforward style**

---

## George Orwell's 6 Rules

From "Politics and the English Language" (1946):

1. **Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print** (avoid clichés)
2. **Never use a long word where a short one will do**
3. **If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out**
4. **Never use the passive where you can use the active**
5. **Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent**
6. **Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous**

---

## Tools for Writing

McCloskey recommends specific tools for the craft:

1. **Dictionary** - Look up words you're unsure about
2. **Thesaurus** - Find the right word (but beware elegant variation)
3. **Word Processor** - Revise easily, experiment freely
4. **Commonplace Book** - Record good sentences you admire
5. **The File** (C. Wright Mills) - Cards, notes, constant rearrangement
6. **Good Writing** - Read the best old books, read poetry out loud, memorize some

---

## How to Develop Taste

**Read Good Writing:**
- Read the best old books
- Read poetry out loud
- Memorize some of it
- Pay attention to what makes good writing work

**Examples McCloskey Recommends:**
- George Orwell's essays
- E.B. White
- John McPhee
- Anthony Trollope
- Samuel Johnson

**Avoid:**
- Most academic prose (it's bad)
- Bureaucratic writing
- Legal writing (unless you're a lawyer)

**Study Economics Writers Who Write Well:**
- John Kenneth Galbraith
- Robert Solow
- Thomas Schelling
- Paul Krugman
- Albert Hirschman

---

## The Apprenticeship Model

Writing is like "good sewing or carpentry, watching what you're doing and giving it some thought."

**Key aspects:**
1. **Practice** - Write constantly
2. **Feedback** - Seek criticism, don't defend mistakes
3. **Revision** - "Check and tighten, check and tighten"
4. **Imitation** - Copy masters (then find your voice)
5. **Patience** - Skill develops over years

**Professional vs. Amateur Attitude:**
- Professionals take criticism and improve
- Amateurs defend their mistakes as "character traits"
- "We all can use more criticism"

---

## The Great Conversation

Education is "an initiation... in which we acquire the intellectual and moral habits appropriate to conversation" (Michael Oakeshott).

**Writing as Conversation:**
- You join an ongoing discussion
- You respond to others, others respond to you
- Standards are social, not individual
- Clarity serves the conversation
- Pomposity and obscurity are anti-social

**The Goal:**
Contribute usefully to the great conversation of economics and ideas.

---

## Final Synthesis: McCloskey's Core Message

**The Tension McCloskey Addresses:**

**Miss Jones' Fake Rules** → Create bad habits
- Say what you'll say, say it, say you said it
- Never repeat words
- Write fancy, not common
- Never use "I"

vs.

**Real Craft Principles** → Take work to learn
- Just say it once, clearly
- Repeat key words for coherence
- Write plain, concrete language
- Use "I" when appropriate

---

**Scientific Pretension** → Pompous jargon
- "The existence of a negative correlation..."
- "Data reanalysis need exists..."
- "Methodology implementation via..."

vs.

**Actual Clarity** → Plain concrete language
- "Prices and quantities moved together..."
- "We must reanalyze the data..."
- "We used this method..."

---

**Boilerplate Structures** → Boring, wasteful
- Table of contents paragraphs
- "This paper..." beginnings
- Section roadmaps
- Rederived basic theory

vs.

**Artful Arrangement** → Engaging, efficient
- Get to the point
- Make it interesting
- Let structure emerge from content
- Assume reader intelligence

---

## The Ultimate Message

**Writing well is:**
- A learnable craft
- A social responsibility
- A form of thinking
- A source of joy (when done well)

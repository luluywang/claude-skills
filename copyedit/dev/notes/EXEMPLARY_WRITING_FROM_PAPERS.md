# Exemplary Writing from Economics Papers

This document provides concrete examples of excellent writing from four published economics papers that demonstrate key principles from the writing guides. Each example includes the quoted passage, identifies which paper it's from, explains which writing principle(s) it demonstrates, and explains why it's effective.

## 1. STRONG OPENING SENTENCES & ABSTRACTS

### Example 1.1: Mankiw, Romer, Weil (QJE 1992) - Abstract

**Passage:**
> "This paper examines whether the Solow growth model is consistent with the international variation in the standard of living. It shows that an augmented Solow model that includes accumulation of human as well as physical capital provides an excellent description of the cross-country data."

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- Central contribution stated immediately
- Concrete language ("augmented Solow model...provides an excellent description")
- Active verbs ("examines," "shows")
- No throat-clearing or philosophy

**Why It's Effective:**
The abstract immediately tells readers what the paper does and what it finds. The authors don't start with general statements about the importance of growth theory. Instead, they get straight to the point: they test the Solow model and find that an augmented version works well. The verb "shows" is definitive rather than hedging ("suggests," "may indicate"), and the phrase "excellent description" is concrete evidence that the model fits.

---

### Example 1.2: EITC Paper - Opening Paragraph

**Passage:**
> "We estimate the impacts of the Earned Income Tax Credit on labor supply using local variation in knowledge about the EITC schedule. We proxy for EITC knowledge in a ZIP code with the fraction of individuals who manipulate reported self-employment income to maximize their EITC refund. This measure varies significantly across areas. We exploit changes in EITC eligibility at the birth of a child to estimate labor supply effects."

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- Central contribution in first sentences
- Concrete research design described immediately
- No warm-up or motivation
- Active voice throughout

**Why It's Effective:**
Four crisp sentences that tell you exactly what the paper does. No discussion of "economists have long wondered" or "labor supply is important." The authors jump straight to their specific approach: they use geographic variation in knowledge, they have a clever proxy for that knowledge, and they use child birth as a natural experiment. A reader immediately knows the paper's empirical strategy.

---

### Example 1.3: Advertising Pricing Paper - Abstract Opening

**Passage:**
> "Existing theories of media competition imply that advertisers will pay a lower price in equilibrium to reach consumers who multi-home across competing outlets. We generalize, extend, and test this prediction. We find that television outlets whose viewers watch more television charge a lower price per impression to advertisers."

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- Theory prediction stated first, then test of that prediction
- Concrete finding stated clearly
- No background or motivation first
- Direct statement of results

**Why It's Effective:**
The abstract starts with a testable prediction from theory, then immediately tells you the empirical finding. The main result is stated in concrete terms: "outlets whose viewers watch more television charge a lower price per impression." This is the inverted pyramid structure—the punchline comes first. The abstract doesn't begin by saying "advertising markets are important" or reviewing literature.

---

### Example 1.4: Securitization Paper - Opening Lines of Introduction

**Passage:**
> "Securitization, converting illiquid assets into liquid securities, has grown tremendously in recent years, with the universe of securitized mortgage loans reaching $3.6 trillion in 2006. The option to sell loans to investors has transformed the traditional role of financial intermediaries in the mortgage market from 'buying and holding' to 'buying and selling.'"

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- Concrete opening with specific numbers
- Clear definition provided immediately
- No abstract philosophy about financial markets
- Sets up the institutional context efficiently

**Why It's Effective:**
The first sentence defines securitization and provides a concrete number ($3.6 trillion) showing its scale. The second sentence crisply characterizes the transformation it created. Within two sentences, readers understand what securitization is and why it matters—all without throat-clearing about the importance of financial innovation.

---

## 2. CLEAR STATEMENT OF CONTRIBUTION

### Example 2.1: Mankiw, Romer, Weil - End of Introduction

**Passage:**
> "Overall, the findings reported in this paper cast doubt on the recent trend among economists to dismiss the Solow growth model in favor of endogenous-growth models that assume constant or increasing returns to scale in capital. One can explain much of the cross-country variation in income while maintaining the assumption of decreasing returns."

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- Clear statement of what the findings mean
- Positions contribution relative to literature
- Concrete claim about what can be explained
- No hedging or excessive modesty

**Why It's Effective:**
This passage clearly states the paper's intellectual contribution: it challenges the move away from the Solow model. The statement is definitive ("cast doubt") rather than tentative. The second sentence provides a concrete claim: "one can explain much of the cross-country variation" while keeping decreasing returns. This tells readers exactly what the paper contributes to the debate.

---

### Example 2.2: EITC Paper - Research Design Statement

**Passage:**
> "Our research design is based on a simple idea: individuals with no knowledge of a tax policy's marginal incentives behave as they would in the absence of the policy. Hence, we can identify the causal effect of a policy by comparing behavior across cities that differ in knowledge about the policy but are otherwise comparable."

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- Distills research design to core insight
- States identification strategy clearly
- Uses simple language for a technical idea
- Clear logical progression (simple idea → hence → identification)

**Why It's Effective:**
The authors reduce their clever identification strategy to a "simple idea" stated in one sentence, then show the logical implication ("Hence"). This makes the research design accessible. The passage demonstrates that clarity doesn't require technical jargon—they could have written about "exogenous variation in information sets" but instead chose plain language.

---

### Example 2.3: Advertising Pricing Paper - Main Finding

**Passage:**
> "We find that television outlets whose viewers watch more television charge a lower price per impression to advertisers. This finding helps rationalize well-known stylized facts such as a premium for younger and more male audiences on television."

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- Main finding stated concretely
- Connection to broader patterns made explicit
- No hedging ("we find" not "our results suggest")
- Clear causal claim

**Why It's Effective:**
The finding is stated as a clear empirical fact with a definite direction (more viewing → lower price). The second sentence immediately shows why this matters: it explains puzzling industry patterns. This structure—specific finding, then broader implication—helps readers see both the result and its significance.

---

### Example 2.4: Securitization Paper - Core Hypothesis

**Passage:**
> "We argue that the lender has a weaker incentive to base origination decisions on both hard and soft information, less carefully screening the borrower, at 620+, where there is an increase in the relative ease of securitization. In other words, because investors purchase securitized loans based on hard information, the cost of collecting soft information is internalized by lenders when screening borrowers at 620+ to a lesser extent than at 620-."

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- Core mechanism stated clearly
- Technical insight then explained in plain language ("In other words")
- Specific prediction about screening at 620+ vs 620-
- Explicit about the "why" behind the prediction

**Why It's Effective:**
The passage first states the hypothesis, then explains the underlying economic logic. The "in other words" construction translates the mechanism into clearer terms. The contrast between 620+ and 620- makes the prediction concrete and testable. Readers understand both what will happen and why.

---

## 3. EFFECTIVE PARAGRAPH STRUCTURE

### Example 3.1: Mankiw, Romer, Weil - Paragraph with Clear Topic Sentence

**Passage:**
> "Yet all is not right for the Solow model. Although the model correctly predicts the directions of the effects of saving and population growth, it does not correctly predict the magnitudes. In the data the effects of saving and population growth on income are too large. To understand the relation between saving, population growth, and income, one must go beyond the textbook Solow model."

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- Topic sentence states the main message ("all is not right")
- Following sentences provide supporting evidence
- Paragraph ends with implication/transition
- Logical flow from problem to solution

**Why It's Effective:**
The topic sentence "Yet all is not right" immediately signals a qualification. The next sentences specify the problem (wrong magnitudes), and the final sentence points to the solution (augmenting the model). A reader who skims just the first sentence of each paragraph would understand the paper's logical flow.

---

### Example 3.2: EITC Paper - Paragraph Building on Previous Point

**Passage:**
> "In the second half of the paper, we identify the causal impact of the EITC on wage earnings by using neighborhoods with low levels of sharp bunching among the self-employed (i.e., low-knowledge neighborhoods) as counterfactuals for behavior in the absence of the EITC. Unlike self-employment income, wage earnings are double reported by employers to the IRS on W-2 forms. Misreporting of wage earnings is therefore minimal, and changes in wage earnings are driven by real choices such as hours of work."

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- First sentence states what the paragraph will do
- Following sentences explain key distinctions (W-2 vs self-employment)
- Each sentence builds logically on the previous
- Paragraph structure matches argument structure

**Why It's Effective:**
The paragraph's structure mirrors the logical argument: (1) here's our empirical strategy, (2) here's why wage earnings are special (double reporting), (3) therefore changes reflect real behavior. Each sentence adds one piece of information, building to a clear conclusion. The flow is natural and easy to follow.

---

### Example 3.3: Securitization Paper - Clear Empirical Finding Paragraph

**Passage:**
> "Strikingly, we find that although 620+ loans should be of slightly better credit quality than those at 620-, low-documentation loans that are originated above the credit threshold tend to default within two years of origination at a rate 10%-25% higher than the mean default rate of 5% (which amounts to roughly a 0.5%-1% increase in delinquencies). As this result is conditional on observable loan and borrower characteristics, the only remaining difference between the loans around the threshold is the increased ease of securitization."

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- Opening word "strikingly" signals importance
- Concrete numbers throughout (10-25%, mean of 5%)
- Logic made explicit ("As this result is conditional on...")
- Causal claim clearly stated

**Why It's Effective:**
The paragraph starts with "strikingly" to flag the surprising result. It provides specific magnitudes (not just "higher default") and puts them in context (relative to mean of 5%). The final sentence draws the causal inference explicitly, showing why the result matters for the paper's argument. The combination of concrete numbers and clear logic makes the finding compelling.

---

## 4. CONCISE, ACTIVE LANGUAGE

### Example 4.1: Mankiw, Romer, Weil - Simple Declarative Sentences

**Passage:**
> "This paper takes Robert Solow seriously. In his classic 1956 article Solow proposed that we begin the study of economic growth by assuming a standard neoclassical production function with decreasing returns to capital. Taking the rates of saving and population growth as exogenous, he showed that these two variables determine the steady-state level of income per capita."

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- Short, declarative opening sentence
- Active voice throughout
- Each sentence has one clear idea
- No unnecessary modifiers

**Why It's Effective:**
"This paper takes Robert Solow seriously" is memorable and direct. No throat-clearing about "extensive literature" or "important questions." The subsequent sentences are models of clarity: subject-verb-object with no clutter. "He showed" is better than "it was shown that" or "the results suggest." Each sentence conveys exactly one thought.

---

### Example 4.2: EITC Paper - Direct Statement of Finding

**Passage:**
> "Individuals in high-knowledge areas change wage earnings sharply to obtain larger EITC refunds relative to those in low-knowledge areas. These responses come primarily from intensive-margin earnings increases in the phase-in region."

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- Active verbs ("change," "come")
- Concrete subjects ("individuals," "these responses")
- Specific location of effects ("intensive-margin," "phase-in region")
- No hedging or passive voice

**Why It's Effective:**
The sentences tell you exactly what happens and where. "Individuals change wage earnings" is better than "wage earnings are observed to change" or "there is evidence of earnings changes." The second sentence specifies exactly where the responses occur, making the finding concrete rather than vague.

---

### Example 4.3: Advertising Pricing Paper - Model Intuition

**Passage:**
> "The price per viewer that an owner can charge in equilibrium is then decreasing in the overall activity level of its audience, and increasing in the overall size of its audience."

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- Parallel structure ("decreasing in...increasing in")
- Precise language (not "related to" but specific direction)
- Complete thought in one sentence
- Technical precision without jargon

**Why It's Effective:**
This sentence conveys the model's key comparative statics in 25 words with perfect clarity. The parallel structure ("decreasing in...increasing in") makes the two effects easy to compare. The precision of "activity level" and "size" means no ambiguity about what varies. This is technical writing at its best—exact but accessible.

---

### Example 4.4: Securitization Paper - Research Design Motivation

**Passage:**
> "The challenge in making a causal claim is the difficulty of isolating differences in loan outcomes independent of contract and borrower characteristics."

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- Concrete problem statement
- Active noun as subject ("challenge")
- Precise about the difficulty
- Plain language for methodological point

**Why It's Effective:**
This sentence clearly states the identification problem without methodological jargon. It doesn't say "endogeneity concerns" or "selection on unobservables"—it describes the actual problem in concrete terms. Any reader, even without econometric training, can understand why comparing securitized and non-securitized loans is difficult.

---

## 5. CLEAR PRESENTATION OF RESULTS

### Example 5.1: Mankiw, Romer, Weil - Presenting Regression Results

**Passage:**
> "Three aspects of the results support the Solow model. First, the coefficients on saving and population growth have the predicted signs and, for two of the three samples, are highly significant. Second, the restriction that the coefficients on ln(s) and ln(n + g + δ) are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign is not rejected in any of the samples. Third, and perhaps most important, differences in saving and population growth account for a large fraction of the cross-country variation in income per capita."

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- Results organized with clear signposting (First, Second, Third)
- Each point is one complete thought
- Quantitative results described in words
- Emphasis on economic significance ("most important")

**Why It's Effective:**
The structure makes results easy to follow. The "First, Second, Third" organization helps readers track multiple findings. Notably, the authors emphasize the R² result as "most important"—highlighting economic significance over statistical significance. They interpret results for readers rather than just reporting coefficients.

---

### Example 5.2: EITC Paper - Quantitative Magnitude

**Passage:**
> "Comparing changes in earnings around child birth in high vs. low knowledge neighborhoods, we estimate that earnings responses to the EITC increase total refund amounts by approximately 5 percent on average across the U.S. Approximately 75 percent of the increase in EITC refunds due to behavioral responses comes from individuals who change the amount they earn rather than whether they work or not, showing that the EITC has substantial intensive margin impacts."

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- Specific quantitative findings (5%, 75%)
- Effects scaled to policy-relevant units (refund amounts)
- Interpretation immediately follows numbers
- Clear statement of policy implication

**Why It's Effective:**
The passage provides concrete magnitudes (5%, 75%) and immediately interprets what they mean: the EITC has "substantial intensive margin impacts." The results are scaled to dollars (refund amounts) rather than left as elasticities, making them policy-relevant. The sequence—finding, then interpretation—helps readers understand both the number and its significance.

---

### Example 5.3: Securitization Paper - Establishing the Discontinuity

**Passage:**
> "For loans with a potential for significant soft information—low documentation loans—we find that there are more than twice as many loans securitized above the credit threshold at 620+ than below the threshold at 620-. Because the FICO score distribution in the population is smooth (constructed from a logistic function; see Figure I), the underlying creditworthiness and demand for mortgage loans (at a given price) are the same for prospective buyers with a credit score of either 620- or 620+."

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- Quantitative finding stated precisely ("more than twice")
- Evidence for key assumption provided immediately
- Figure reference integrated into text
- Logic of inference made explicit

**Why It's Effective:**
The passage states the empirical pattern, then immediately addresses why it's meaningful. The parenthetical about the logistic function is just enough detail without disrupting the flow. The inference is stated clearly: since the distribution is smooth, the jump must reflect something other than borrower quality. This is identification logic made transparent.

---

### Example 5.4: Advertising Pricing Paper - Model Fit

**Passage:**
> "We find that the model's predictions are a good fit to observed prices. Predicted prices explain 34.0 to 35.1 percent of the variation in price per impression across owners, with a slope close to unity in the specification that incorporates viewer income."

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- Clear assessment of fit ("good fit")
- Specific R² reported with appropriate precision
- Additional diagnostic mentioned (slope close to unity)
- No over-claiming or hedging

**Why It's Effective:**
The passage gives readers the information they need to judge model fit: R², slope coefficient. The authors are honest ("34-35%") rather than spinning the results. Saying "slope close to unity" provides additional confidence in the model beyond just R². The assessment is balanced—good fit, but not perfect.

---

## 6. EFFECTIVE TRANSITIONS AND LOGICAL FLOW

### Example 6.1: Mankiw, Romer, Weil - Transition Between Sections

**Passage:**
> "After developing and testing the augmented Solow model, we examine an issue that has received much attention in recent years: the failure of countries to converge in per capita income. We argue that one should not expect convergence. Rather, the Solow model predicts that countries generally reach different steady states."

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- Clear transition ("After developing and testing...")
- New topic introduced with context
- Contrasts conventional view with paper's argument
- Word repetition for coherence ("convergence")

**Why It's Effective:**
The transition makes the paper's organization clear: first the model, now an application. The word "convergence" links sentences. The contrast ("argue...one should not expect" vs. "received much attention") sets up tension that propels the reader forward. The transition is functional, not decorative.

---

### Example 6.2: EITC Paper - Linking Empirical Strategy to Results

**Passage:**
> "In the second half of the paper, we identify the causal impact of the EITC on wage earnings by using neighborhoods with low levels of sharp bunching among the self-employed (i.e., low-knowledge neighborhoods) as counterfactuals for behavior in the absence of the EITC."

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- Clear roadmap ("In the second half")
- Links back to first-half findings (bunching measure)
- Explains what the measure will be used for
- Parenthetical clarification smoothly integrated

**Why It's Effective:**
This sentence tells readers where they are in the paper and what's coming next. It links the two halves: the bunching measure developed in part one becomes the key to identification in part two. The parenthetical "(i.e., low-knowledge neighborhoods)" helps readers who might have lost track of what bunching means.

---

### Example 6.3: Securitization Paper - Addressing Alternative Explanations

**Passage:**
> "Could the 620 threshold be set by lenders as an optimal cutoff for screening that is unrelated to differential securitization? We investigate further using a natural experiment in the passage and subsequent repeal of antipredatory laws in New Jersey (2002) and Georgia (2003) that varied the ease of securitization around the threshold."

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- Acknowledges alternative explanation as question
- Immediately provides the test
- Specific institutional details (states, dates)
- Clear causal logic (laws → ease of securitization)

**Why It's Effective:**
The paragraph starts with the alternative explanation as a direct question, making the logic transparent. The answer follows immediately: here's a test. The specificity (which states, which years) gives confidence that this is real evidence, not speculation. The transition from question to answer is seamless.

---

## 7. INVERTED PYRAMID STRUCTURE

### Example 7.1: Mankiw, Romer, Weil - Introduction Structure

**Passage:**
The introduction starts with the contribution (testing the Solow model), then the main result (augmented model works well), then qualifications (but magnitudes are off), then the fix (add human capital), then detailed results, then implications. The most important information comes first, with progressively more detail for readers who continue.

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- Punchline in first paragraph
- Each subsequent paragraph adds detail
- Never makes readers wait for main finding
- Can stop reading at any point with key takeaway

**Why It's Effective:**
A busy reader who stops after paragraph one knows the paper tests the Solow model and finds it works with human capital added. A reader who continues learns about the specific problems with the textbook model, then how human capital solves them, then the convergence implications. The structure respects readers' time.

---

### Example 7.2: EITC Paper - Abstract Structure

**Passage:**
The abstract opens with the research design (geographic variation in knowledge), then the main finding (individuals respond by changing earnings), then the source of responses (intensive margin in phase-in region). Each sentence provides progressively more detail about the same core result.

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- Most important information first
- Progressive elaboration
- No literature review in abstract
- Concrete from first sentence

**Why It's Effective:**
Even if a reader stops after the first sentence, they know the paper's approach. The second sentence gives the main result. The third sentence adds detail about where responses come from. This layered structure means readers can stop at any point and have learned something valuable.

---

## 8. CONCRETE LANGUAGE & EXAMPLES

### Example 8.1: Advertising Pricing Paper - Concrete Example

**Passage:**
> "For example, 6.5 percent of EITC claimants in Chicago, IL in 2008 are self-employed and report earnings exactly at the refund-maximizing level, compared with 0.6 percent in Rapid City, SD."

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- Specific cities (Chicago vs. Rapid City)
- Specific percentages (6.5% vs. 0.6%)
- Specific year (2008)
- Concrete behavior described

**Why It's Effective:**
Rather than saying "bunching varies across cities," the authors give a concrete example with real places and numbers. The 10-fold difference (6.5% vs. 0.6%) is more vivid than a regression coefficient. The specificity makes the variation real and memorable.

---

### Example 8.2: Mankiw, Romer, Weil - Concrete Magnitudes

**Passage:**
> "For example, if α = β = 1/3 and n + g + δ = 0.06, then the convergence rate (λ) would equal 0.02. This implies that the economy moves halfway to steady state in about 35 years."

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- Specific parameter values
- Specific implied convergence rate
- Translation to intuitive units (years to half-life)
- "For example" signals concrete illustration

**Why It's Effective:**
The passage takes abstract parameters (α, β, λ) and shows what they mean in practice: it takes 35 years to get halfway to steady state. This makes the speed of convergence concrete. Readers don't need to understand log-linearization to grasp that 35 years is slow convergence.

---

### Example 8.3: Securitization Paper - Dollar Amounts

**Passage:**
> "Inside B&C Lending—a publication that covers subprime mortgage lending extensively—reports that total subprime lending (B&C originations) grew from $65 billion in 1995 to $500 billion in 2005."

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- Specific dollar amounts ($65B to $500B)
- Specific source cited
- Specific time period (1995 to 2005)
- Concrete institutional detail

**Why It's Effective:**
Rather than saying "subprime lending grew substantially," the authors provide concrete numbers showing nearly 8-fold growth. The source citation adds credibility. The magnitude of growth ($65B to $500B) helps readers understand why subprime lending became important enough to study.

---

## 9. CLEAR TOPIC SENTENCES

### Example 9.1: Mankiw, Romer, Weil - Section Opening

**Passage:**
> "Economists have long stressed the importance of human capital to the process of growth."

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- Topic sentence states the section's subject
- Broad context before narrow details
- Sets up motivation for analysis
- Simple, declarative sentence

**Why It's Effective:**
This topic sentence tells readers the paragraph will be about human capital. It provides context (this is a recognized issue) before diving into specifics. A reader skimming first sentences would know this section introduces human capital into the model.

---

### Example 9.2: EITC Paper - Results Section Opening

**Passage:**
> "We find that the wage earnings distribution exhibits more mass around the refund-maximizing EITC plateau in neighborhoods with high self-employed sharp bunching, indicating that the EITC affects labor supply choices in high-knowledge areas."

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- First sentence states main finding
- Links finding to interpretation immediately
- Subject is concrete ("wage earnings distribution")
- Finding specified precisely (where mass is)

**Why It's Effective:**
The topic sentence conveys the key result: earnings bunch where knowledge is high. The interpretation follows in the same sentence. A reader who only reads this sentence knows the paper finds EITC affects labor supply, with the effect varying by knowledge.

---

### Example 9.3: Securitization Paper - Methodological Paragraph

**Passage:**
> "To evaluate the effect of securitization on screening decisions, we examine the performance of loans originated by lenders around this threshold."

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- States what the paragraph will do
- Links method to research question
- Concrete subject and verb
- Sets up what follows

**Why It's Effective:**
This topic sentence tells readers the empirical strategy: compare loan performance around the threshold. It connects to the research question (effect on screening) and sets up the detailed analysis that follows. The paragraph's structure matches its opening promise.

---

## 10. HANDLING TECHNICAL MATERIAL CLEARLY

### Example 10.1: Mankiw, Romer, Weil - Explaining Identification

**Passage:**
> "We assume that g and δ are constant across countries. g reflects primarily the advancement of knowledge, which is not country-specific. And there is neither any strong reason to expect depreciation rates to vary greatly across countries, nor are there any data that would allow us to estimate country-specific depreciation rates."

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- Technical assumption stated first
- Economic intuition provided (advancement of knowledge)
- Practical justification added (no data)
- Accessible language throughout

**Why It's Effective:**
The passage explains a technical assumption (g and δ constant) using economic reasoning (knowledge is global) and practical constraints (no data for country-specific rates). This triple justification—assumption, theory, data—makes the choice transparent. Technical readers understand the assumption; general readers see it's reasonable.

---

### Example 10.2: EITC Paper - Model Setup

**Passage:**
> "Individuals have quasi-linear utility functions u(C_i, l_i; θ_i) = C_i - h(l_i; θ_i) over a numéraire consumption good C_i and labor supply l_i. The parameter θ_i captures skill or preference heterogeneity across agents."

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- Math notation followed by words
- Parameters explained immediately
- Functional form stated, then interpreted
- Plain language for what θ means

**Why It's Effective:**
The passage doesn't assume readers remember what quasi-linear means or what θ represents. Each piece of notation is explained ("captures skill or preference heterogeneity"). The explanation follows immediately after the math, making the model accessible.

---

### Example 10.3: Securitization Paper - Statistical Test Explanation

**Passage:**
> "We also conduct permutation tests (or 'randomization' tests), where we vary the location of the discontinuity (T_i) across the range of all possible FICO scores and reestimate equation (1). The test treats every value of the FICO distribution as a potential discontinuity, and estimates the magnitude of the observed discontinuity at each point, forming a counterfactual distribution of discontinuity estimates."

**Writing Principles Demonstrated:**
- Alternative name given ("randomization tests")
- Procedure described in plain language
- Logic of test made clear (counterfactual distribution)
- No assumed knowledge of permutation tests

**Why It's Effective:**
Rather than just writing "we conduct permutation tests," the authors explain what that means: vary the threshold and see if 620 stands out. The explanation assumes no prior knowledge. Technical readers can skip this; others learn what the test does.

---

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

These examples demonstrate several patterns of excellent writing:

1. **Lead with findings**: All four papers state their main results early and concretely.

2. **Use specific numbers**: Rather than saying "substantial" or "significant," these papers give exact magnitudes (10-25%, twice as many, 35% of variation).

3. **Translate technical points**: Complex methods and models are explained in accessible language alongside formal notation.

4. **One idea per sentence**: Even when discussing complex material, sentences tend to convey one clear thought.

5. **Active voice dominates**: "We find," "We show," "We estimate" rather than passive constructions.

6. **Logical flow explicit**: Papers use transitions, signposting, and parallel structure to guide readers.

7. **Assumptions justified**: When making technical assumptions, authors provide economic intuition and practical reasons.

8. **Results interpreted**: Numbers are not just reported but explained in economic terms.

These patterns reflect the core principles from the writing guides: inverted pyramid structure, concrete language, clear topic sentences, active voice, and respect for readers' time. The papers succeed because they make it easy for readers to extract information at whatever level of detail they need.

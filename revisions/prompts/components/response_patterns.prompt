# Response Style Conventions

**Purpose:** Define the voice, tone, and formatting patterns for draft responses, extracted from the user's prior response documents.

---

## Voice & Tone

- **First person singular**: "I have revised...", "I now clarify...", "I was unable to..."
- **Formal but direct**: No hedging or filler. State what was done and why.
- **Gracious but not obsequious**: Thank the referee, then get to the substance.
- **Acknowledge legitimate concerns**: "You are right that...", "The referee is correct that..."
- **Don't be defensive**: If the criticism is valid, say so directly and explain the fix.

## Opening Patterns

Match the opening to the comment type:

### Substantive (high priority)
- Jump straight to the substance: the economic mechanism, identification argument, or what changed.
- When thanking, name what was helpful: "Thank you for suggesting the dual-routing counterfactual — it strengthened the welfare analysis."
- "Your conjecture is correct: [restate the conjecture]."

### Clarification
- "I have clarified [topic] in Section \ref{...}."

### Minor
- "Thank you, I have corrected this."
- "I have fixed this typo."
- "Thank you for catching this."

## Body Patterns

### Enumerating Changes

When multiple changes address one comment, use `\begin{enumerate}`:

```latex
I have made two changes to address this concern.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item I have added [specific change] in Section \ref{...}.
  \item I have clarified [specific change] in Section \ref{...}.
\end{enumerate}
```

### Referencing Specific Content

Always be specific about what changed and where:
- "I have revised Section \ref{subsec:model-assumptions} to state these limitations directly."
- "I now frame the merchant-type estimation as a calibration exercise."
- "Appendix \ref{subsec:oa-intermediate-cap} studies the case where..."

### Citing Literature

Use the user's citation commands:
- Narrative: `\textcite{Author2020}` → "Author (2020) shows that..."
- Parenthetical: `\parencite{Author2020}` → "...as shown in prior work \parencite{Author2020}."
- Multiple: `\parencite{Author2020, Other2021}`

**Make citations do work.** Every citation must explain WHY you're citing — not just a parenthetical. "Because past work shows X \parencite{Y}" is stronger than "...consistent with prior findings \parencite{Y}."

### Shared Concerns Across Referees

When multiple referees raise the same issue, each response must be self-contained — never reference another referee's response (each referee only reads their own letter). Instead:
- Write independent responses to each referee addressing the shared concern
- Use `\editorcomment{#1}{This responds to concerns by R1 and R4 about [topic]}` in the editor letter only (the editor reads everything)

### Data and Results

When citing specific numbers:
- "The F-statistic drops from 23 to 4 in services."
- Use `\scalarinput{variable_name}` when the user has dynamic scalar inputs.
- "I arrive at a similar estimate that [specific finding]."

## Substance Over Procedure

### Lead with the economic mechanism (not procedure)
Don't open with "I have revised the discussion of X." Instead, state the actual identification argument, economic mechanism, or substantive point — then note where the revision appears.

### Be honest about model limitations
When the model can't answer a question, say so: "The model is not well-suited to answer this question." Don't attempt answers the model can't support.

### Name the exact constraint
Not "the data are not precise enough" but "the DCPC has limited AmEx coverage." Not "a small number of events" but "only two clear cases." Specificity is more credible and more useful.

### Distinguish claims from evidence
Hedge mechanisms, not facts. When the data doesn't directly show a mechanism: "While the data does not provide direct evidence on the mechanism, one possibility consistent with testimony is..."

### Give concrete examples of assumption violations
When discussing identifying assumptions, don't just state them abstractly — show what would violate them. E.g., "A co-branded card campaign that shifts both acceptance and card holdings would violate this assumption."

### Reference literature, don't re-derive
When a theoretical result is already established: "The theoretical literature has already established this... I take the benchmark and evaluate it directly." Don't re-derive known results.

### State the contribution clearly
Distinguish what the paper adds from what it borrows. Be explicit about the paper's unique contribution relative to prior work.

## Structure

### Consolidate related comments
When 2-3 related referee comments cover the same ground, consolidate into a single unified reply rather than repeating similar arguments across separate responses. Each comment can still get a brief individual acknowledgment, but the substantive reasoning belongs in one place.

## Length Scaling

| Comment Type | Target Length |
|---|---|
| Typo / formatting | 1 sentence |
| Minor suggestion | 2-3 sentences |
| Clarification | 1 paragraph (4-6 sentences) |
| Standard substantive | 2-3 paragraphs, often with `\begin{enumerate}` |
| Hard substantive | Multi-paragraph with evidence, enumerated changes |

## Formatting Rules

1. **No markdown in responses.** Use LaTeX commands only.
2. **Bold for emphasis**: `\textbf{...}` not `**...**`
3. **Enumerate for lists**: `\begin{enumerate}...\end{enumerate}` not bullet points
4. **U.S. spacing**: `U.S.\ ` with backslash-space after abbreviation periods
5. **Em-dashes**: `---` for em-dashes
6. **Percent**: `\%` in LaTeX context
7. **Dollar amounts**: `\$8 billion`

## Tone: Personal and Humble

### Address the Referee Personally
- Use "you" and "your" when addressing the referee: "In response to your concern about..."
- Prefer "You are exactly right that..." over "The referee raises an important point..."
- Be conversational: "as you note," "your suggestion," "the issue you raise"

### Lead with Concession, Then Pivot
The strongest response structure:
1. Concede the legitimate part of the criticism
2. Pivot to what the referee is missing or what you've done about it

- "I agree that [referee's point]. However, the mechanism in the model operates through [what they're missing]."
- "You are correct that [X]. I have addressed this by [specific action]."
- "This is an important concern. The key distinction is between [A] and [B]."

### Be Humble
- Acknowledge limitations rather than defending everything
- "I should have been clearer about this" is better than explaining why the referee misread
- When asked to do more work, "elevate the fact that I did the work" — show the referee you took their concern seriously

### No Cross-Referee References
Each referee only reads their OWN response letter. NEVER write:
- "As I noted in my response to Referee 2..."
- "The referee raises a concern similar to Referee 1's Comment 3..."
- "This also addresses the concern raised by Referee N about..."

Each response must be self-contained. If the same issue spans referees, write independent responses to each. Use `\editorcomment{}` to flag shared concerns only in the editor letter.

### Cite Specific Locations
Referees should know exactly where to look:
- "I have revised Section \ref{subsec:model-assumptions} to state these limitations directly."
- "See the footnote on page [X] for the identifying assumption."
- Always point to: equations, sections, footnotes, appendix locations, table/figure numbers.

### Confidentiality Awareness
Some content cannot go in the published paper due to data disclosure requirements:
- Single-firm results, retailer-specific charts → referee response only
- "Data disclosure requirements mean I can't put these results in the paper, but I include them here for the referee's review."
- Move confidential charts/tables to the response letter, not the main text or appendix.

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

- "I would like to thank the referee for this excellent suggestion." → Too sycophantic
- "While I appreciate the comment, I disagree because..." → Too defensive
- "This has been addressed." → Too vague. Say what was done and where.
- "I have made many changes throughout the paper." → Not specific enough.
- Starting every response with "Thank you for..." → Vary openings.
- Repeating the same explanation for related comments → Cross-reference instead.
- "As the referee noted in an earlier comment..." when referencing a DIFFERENT referee → Wrong audience
- Packing in more content than the referee asked for → Looks like anticipating criticism
- Multi-paragraph response for a typo or minor suggestion → Scale length to comment importance
- Generic throat-clearing: "The referee raises an important point," "This is an interesting thought experiment," "I apologize for not being clear" → Just answer the question.
- Self-congratulatory framing: "This approach has two main advantages..." → Let the evidence speak.
- Vague cross-references: "I clarified this in the text" → Say where: "see footnote~\ref{foot:surcharge-equivalence}"

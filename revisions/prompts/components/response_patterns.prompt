# Response Style Conventions

**Purpose:** Define the voice, tone, and formatting patterns for draft responses, extracted from the user's prior response documents.

---

## Voice & Tone

- **First person singular**: "I have revised...", "I now clarify...", "I was unable to..."
- **Formal but direct**: No hedging or filler. State what was done and why.
- **Gracious but not obsequious**: Thank the referee, then get to the substance.
- **Acknowledge legitimate concerns**: "You are right that...", "The referee is correct that..."
- **Don't be defensive**: If the criticism is valid, say so directly and explain the fix.

## Opening Patterns

Match the opening to the comment type:

### Substantive (high priority)
- "Thank you for this suggestion."
- "Thank you for your suggestions on how to [address X]."
- "This is an important point."
- "Thank you for this advice."

### Clarification
- "Thank you for flagging this."
- "I have clarified [topic] in Section \ref{...}."
- "Your conjecture is correct: [restate the conjecture]."

### Minor
- "Thank you, I have corrected this."
- "I have fixed this typo."
- "Thank you for catching this."

### Apologetic (when prior response was inadequate)
- "I apologize for not being clear."
- "I should have been clearer about this in the previous version."

## Body Patterns

### Enumerating Changes

When multiple changes address one comment, use `\begin{enumerate}`:

```latex
I have made two changes to address this concern.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item I have added [specific change] in Section \ref{...}.
  \item I have clarified [specific change] in Section \ref{...}.
\end{enumerate}
```

### Referencing Specific Content

Always be specific about what changed and where:
- "I have revised Section \ref{subsec:model-assumptions} to state these limitations directly."
- "I now frame the merchant-type estimation as a calibration exercise."
- "Appendix \ref{subsec:oa-intermediate-cap} studies the case where..."

### Citing Literature

Use the user's citation commands:
- Narrative: `\textcite{Author2020}` → "Author (2020) shows that..."
- Parenthetical: `\parencite{Author2020}` → "...as shown in prior work \parencite{Author2020}."
- Multiple: `\parencite{Author2020, Other2021}`

### Cross-Referencing Other Responses

When the same issue spans referees:
- "This also addresses the concern raised by Referee N about [topic]."
- "I discuss this further in my response to the Editor's comment (a)."
- Use `\editorcomment{#1}{These responds to concerns by R1 and R4 about [topic]}` if the command is available.

### Data and Results

When citing specific numbers:
- "The F-statistic drops from 23 to 4 in services."
- Use `\scalarinput{variable_name}` when the user has dynamic scalar inputs.
- "I arrive at a similar estimate that [specific finding]."

## Length Scaling

| Comment Type | Target Length |
|---|---|
| Typo / formatting | 1 sentence |
| Minor suggestion | 2-3 sentences |
| Clarification | 1 paragraph (4-6 sentences) |
| Standard substantive | 2-3 paragraphs, often with `\begin{enumerate}` |
| Hard substantive | Multi-paragraph with evidence, enumerated changes |

## Formatting Rules

1. **No markdown in responses.** Use LaTeX commands only.
2. **Bold for emphasis**: `\textbf{...}` not `**...**`
3. **Enumerate for lists**: `\begin{enumerate}...\end{enumerate}` not bullet points
4. **U.S. spacing**: `U.S.\ ` with backslash-space after abbreviation periods
5. **Em-dashes**: `---` for em-dashes
6. **Percent**: `\%` in LaTeX context
7. **Dollar amounts**: `\$8 billion`

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

- "I would like to thank the referee for this excellent suggestion." → Too sycophantic
- "While I appreciate the comment, I disagree because..." → Too defensive
- "This has been addressed." → Too vague. Say what was done and where.
- "I have made many changes throughout the paper." → Not specific enough.
- Starting every response with "Thank you for..." → Vary openings.
- Repeating the same explanation for related comments → Cross-reference instead.

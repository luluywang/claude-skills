# LaTeX Conventions Reference

**Purpose:** Reference for LaTeX environments, commands, and document structure used in economics manuscripts and response documents.

---

## Response Document Structure

The response document follows this structure:

```
1. Preamble (document class, bibliography, custom commands)
2. Opening letter to editor
3. Summary of Main Changes (enumerated)
4. Detailed Response to Editor Letter (refsection)
5. Detailed Response to Referee 1 (refsection)
6. Detailed Response to Referee 2 (refsection)
7. ... (one refsection per referee)
```

## Key Environments

### refcommentnoclear

Wraps the referee's original comment (typically rendered in blue):

```latex
\begin{refcommentnoclear}
  Full text of the referee's comment, preserved exactly as written.
\end{refcommentnoclear}
```

### refsection

Scopes bibliography to a section. Each referee's section gets its own `refsection`:

```latex
\begin{refsection}
\section*{Detailed Response to Referee 1}
% comments and responses
\printbibliography
\end{refsection}
```

### Reply Marker

Responses always begin with `\textbf{Reply:}` (with a space after the colon), immediately after the `\end{refcommentnoclear}`.

## Cross-Referencing Commands

### Section/Figure/Table References

- `\ref{label}` — produces the number (e.g., "3.2")
- `\label{key}` — marks a location for referencing
- Common label prefixes:
  - `sec:` or `subsec:` — sections
  - `tab:` — tables
  - `fig:` — figures
  - `eq:` — equations
  - `fn:` — footnotes (less common)

### Citation Commands (biblatex)

- `\textcite{key}` — narrative citation: "Author (2020) shows..."
- `\parencite{key}` — parenthetical: "...as shown (Author, 2020)."
- `\parencite{key1, key2}` — multiple parenthetical citations
- `\citet{key}` — alternative narrative citation (natbib style)
- `\citep{key}` — alternative parenthetical (natbib style)

### Dynamic Values

- `\scalarinput{variable_name}` — pulls a computed value from a separate file (common in reproducible economics papers)

## LLM Edit Tagging

All content written or modified by LLM agents MUST be wrapped in `\begin{llm}...\end{llm}` tags for user review tracking:

```latex
\begin{llm}
The results are weaker once we use the full sample, with the F-statistic
declining from 23 to 4 in the services subsample.
\end{llm}
```

**Rules for LLM tags:**
- Wrap the **minimum necessary** text — the sentence or paragraph actually added/changed
- Do NOT wrap surrounding unchanged text
- For multi-paragraph additions, one `\begin{llm}...\end{llm}` block is fine
- Tags are stripped by the user before final submission — they are review markers only
- If the `llm` environment is not defined in the manuscript preamble, add:
  ```latex
  \newenvironment{llm}{}{}  % LLM-written content marker (strip before submission)
  ```

## Common Manuscript Structure

Economics papers typically follow:

```
\section{Introduction}
\section{Institutional Background / Context}
\section{Model / Theoretical Framework}
\section{Data}
\section{Empirical Strategy / Identification}
\section{Results}
  \subsection{Main Results}
  \subsection{Robustness}
  \subsection{Heterogeneity}
\section{Conclusion}

% Appendix (often in separate file or after \appendix command)
\appendix
\section{Online Appendix: Additional Tables}
\section{Online Appendix: Model Derivations}
```

## File Organization

Economics manuscripts commonly use:
- `main.tex` or `paper.tex` — main document
- `appendix.tex` or `online_appendix.tex` — supplementary material
- `Bibliography.bib` or `references.bib` — bibliography database
- `subfiles` package — for modular compilation
- Tables often in `tables/` directory as separate .tex files

## Formatting Notes

- `\clearpage` between major sections
- `\newpage{}` for softer page breaks
- No blank line between `\end{refcommentnoclear}` and `\textbf{Reply:}`
- Blank line after reply content before next `\begin{refcommentnoclear}`
- U.S. spacing: `U.S.\ ` with backslash-space
- Em-dashes: `---`
- Percent: `\%`

## Adapting to User's Manuscript

When working with a specific manuscript:
1. Identify all `\label{}` commands and their locations
2. Identify the bibliography file path from `\addbibresource{}` or `\bibliography{}`
3. Note any custom commands in the preamble
4. Identify whether the paper uses `subfiles`, `\input{}`, or `\include{}`
5. Map the section structure to understand where content should go

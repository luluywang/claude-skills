# LaTeX Template Specification

**Purpose:** Define the document skeleton and custom commands for compiled response documents.

---

## Document Structure

The response document follows this structure:

```
1. Preamble (document class, bibliography, custom commands)
2. Opening letter to editor
3. Summary of Main Changes (enumerated)
4. Detailed Response to Editor Letter (refsection)
5. Detailed Response to Referee 1 (refsection)
6. Detailed Response to Referee 2 (refsection)
7. ... (one refsection per referee)
```

## Preamble

```latex
\documentclass[main.tex]{subfiles}

\addbibresource{../Bibliography.bib}

\begin{document}
\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
\setlength{\parskip}{0.5em}
```

Adjust `\addbibresource` path based on the user's manuscript location.

## Custom Commands

### Editor Comment Toggle

Shows/hides marginal notes indicating which referees are addressed:

```latex
\newcommand{\editorcomment}[2]{
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#1}{1}}{#2}{}
}
```

### Summary of Changes

```latex
\newcommand{\summarizechangeeditor}[1]{
    \section*{Summary of the Main Changes}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Theme 1.} Description of changes...
        \editorcomment{#1}{These responds to concerns by R1 and R4 about [topic]}.
        \item \textbf{Theme 2.} Description of changes...
        ...
    \end{enumerate}
}
```

### Referee Letter Boilerplate

```latex
\newcommand{\refereeletter}{
Dear Referee,

Thank you for carefully reading the previous version of the paper and providing me with great comments and suggestions. I think that the paper has improved substantially thanks to your suggested revisions.

This letter has two sections:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The first section summarizes the key changes to the manuscript.
    \item The second section reports a detailed answer to each of the comments and suggestions in your letter. For each point, I first report your comment (in blue) and then discuss how I modified the paper and extended my analysis to address it.
\end{enumerate}

Sincerely,

[Author Name]
\clearpage

\summarizechangeeditor{0}
\clearpage
}
```

## Page Numbering

```latex
\setcounter{footnote}{0}
\pagenumbering{arabic}
\renewcommand{\thepage}{E-\arabic{page}}
```

The `E-` prefix is for the editor letter. Referee sections may use different prefixes (e.g., `R1-`, `R2-`).

## Section Structure

### Opening Letter to Editor

```latex
Dear Professor [Editor Name],

Thank you for granting me the opportunity to re-submit my paper "[Paper Title]" to the [Journal Name].

[1-2 paragraphs of gratitude and overview]

This letter has two sections:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The first section summarizes the key changes to the manuscript.
    \item The second section reports a detailed answer to each of the comments and suggestions in your letter.
\end{enumerate}

[Mention attached referee response letters]

[Author Name]

\newpage{}
\summarizechangeeditor{1}
\newpage{}
```

### Editor Response Section

```latex
\begin{refsection}
\section*{Detailed Response to the Editor Letter}

\begin{refcommentnoclear}
  [editor comment text]
\end{refcommentnoclear}
\textbf{Reply:} [response text]

% Repeat for each editor comment

\clearpage
\printbibliography
\end{refsection}
```

### Referee Response Sections

```latex
\begin{refsection}
\section*{Detailed Response to Referee N}

% Optional: \refereeletter  (if using the boilerplate command)

\begin{refcommentnoclear}
  [referee comment text]
\end{refcommentnoclear}
\textbf{Reply:} [response text]

% Repeat for each referee comment

\clearpage
\printbibliography
\end{refsection}
```

## Key Environments

### refcommentnoclear

Displays the referee's original comment (typically rendered in blue):

```latex
\begin{refcommentnoclear}
  Full text of the referee's comment, preserved exactly as written.
  Multi-paragraph comments are fine.
\end{refcommentnoclear}
```

### refsection

Scopes bibliography to a section. Each referee's section gets its own `refsection` so citations are grouped per-referee:

```latex
\begin{refsection}
\section*{...}
% comments and responses
\printbibliography
\end{refsection}
```

## Formatting Notes

- Use `\clearpage` between the editor section and each referee section
- Use `\newpage{}` for softer page breaks within sections
- `\textbf{Reply:}` always has a space after the colon
- No blank line between `\end{refcommentnoclear}` and `\textbf{Reply:}`
- Blank line after `\textbf{Reply:}` content before next `\begin{refcommentnoclear}`

## Adapting to Prior Response

If the user provides a prior response document:
1. Extract all custom commands from the preamble
2. Match the page numbering convention
3. Preserve the author name and editor name
4. Use the same `\addbibresource` path
5. Match the section ordering and boilerplate text
6. Keep any `\scalarinput{}` commands the user has defined

# Writing Quality Standards for Manuscript Edits

**Purpose:** Concrete rules for writing prose that reads as human-authored academic economics. Derived from McCloskey, Cochrane, and Chaubey principles. Referenced by both fixer and critic.

## Rule 1: No AI-Typical Patterns

Your edits will be scrutinized for AI tells. Avoid ALL of the following:

### Meta-Commentary (highest priority — the #1 tell)
- NEVER: "proceeds as follows," "is organized as follows," "we now turn to"
- NEVER: "Let's walk through," "Below is a detailed overview"
- NEVER: "As we can see," "As mentioned above," "It is worth noting"
- NEVER: "This section discusses," "We begin by," "We conclude by"
- Instead: Just say the thing. Don't announce what you're about to say.

### Transitions That Scream LLM
- NEVER start sentences with: Moreover, Additionally, Furthermore, Notably, Importantly, Critically, Crucially
- NEVER: "More broadly," "Taken together," "In contrast," as sentence openers
- NEVER: "Despite these challenges..."
- Instead: Use the subject of the sentence as the transition. Repeat key terms from the prior sentence (McCloskey's Rule of Coherence).

### Smarmy Reframing
- NEVER: "It's not X, it's Y" / "The question isn't... it's..." / "What matters isn't... but rather..."
- These sound clever but are an AI fingerprint. Replace with direct statements.

### AI Vocabulary (ban list)
Never use: align, crucial, delve, elaborate, emphasize, enhance, enduring, foster, garner, highlight, intricate, interplay, pivotal, showcase, tapestry, underscore, leverage, robust, nuanced, multifaceted, comprehensive, facilitate, explicit (when used as intensifier)

### Hedging
- One hedge per claim maximum. Never stack hedges ("roughly appears to suggest").
- If identification is credible, say "we find" not "our results suggest that."
- Cut reflexive softening: "unlikely to be sufficient," "may not fully capture."

### Template Structures
- NEVER: "Not only... but also..." constructions
- NEVER: Rule-of-three padding (artificial three-item lists)
- NEVER: Paragraph-ending restatements of what was just said
- NEVER: "From X to Y" flourishes

## Rule 2: Plain Language

### Anglo-Saxon Over Latin
| Never write | Write instead |
|-------------|---------------|
| utilize | use |
| commence | begin |
| facilitate | help |
| implement | do, carry out |
| prior to | before |
| in order to | to |
| demonstrate | show |
| individuals | people |

**Test:** Would you say this word aloud to a colleague at the whiteboard?

### Concrete Over Abstract
- "Chicago" not "large cities" not "urban areas"
- "bread" not "food" not "consumption goods"
- "workers" not "labor" not "factor inputs"

### Kill Nominalizations
- "make a calculation" → "calculate"
- "conduct an analysis" → "analyze"
- Find the action hiding in the noun. Make it the verb.

---

## Rule 3: Sentence Construction

### Subject-Verb-Object
- Normal S-V-O word order. Complicate only ONE of subject, verb, or object (Gardner's Rule).
- End position = emphasis position. Put the important thing last.

### Active Voice
- "We estimate" not "it is estimated"
- "The cap reduces fees" not "fees are reduced by the cap"
- Use "I" or "we" — take responsibility for claims.

### Vary Sentence Length
- Mix short and long. If every sentence is 20-25 words, it reads as AI.
- After a complex sentence, follow with a short one.

## Rule 4: Economics-Specific

### Cut Verbose Patterns
| Never write | Write instead |
|-------------|---------------|
| We examine the extent to which | How much does X affect Y? |
| has important implications for | affects |
| our analysis focuses on | we study |
| we find evidence suggesting | we find |
| a key advantage is that we observe | we observe |
| the explicit [noun] proceeds | [just describe it] |

### Every Number Must Argue
- Numbers in prose must answer "so what?" If a number doesn't advance the argument, it belongs in a table.
- After any numerical comparison, add a "because" or "since" — trace the causal mechanism.

### Useless Modifiers
- Cut: "interesting," "various," "different," "certain," "particular"
- Never praise your own work: "striking results," "very significant," "highly important"
- Cut adverbs: "very," "clearly," "obviously," "essentially," "basically"

## Rule 5: Match the Author's Voice

Before writing any edit:
1. Read the 3-5 sentences surrounding the insertion point
2. Note the author's: sentence length, tense, person (we/I), notation conventions, citation style
3. Write to match — not to "improve"

The goal is that a reader cannot tell where the author's prose ends and the edit begins.

## Quick Self-Check (apply to every edit)

- [ ] Can any sentence-initial transition be deleted without losing meaning?
- [ ] Is there any word on the AI vocabulary ban list?
- [ ] Are there meta-commentary phrases announcing what comes next?
- [ ] Are there more than one hedge in any sentence?
- [ ] Would a colleague at a whiteboard say this?
- [ ] Does every number answer "so what?"
- [ ] Is the causal mechanism explicit, not just the outcome reported?
- [ ] Does sentence length vary, or is every sentence ~20 words?

# Writing Quality Standards for Manuscript Edits

**Purpose:** Concrete rules for writing prose that reads as human-authored academic economics. Derived from McCloskey, Cochrane, and Chaubey principles. Referenced by both fixer and critic.

---

## Rule 1: No AI-Typical Patterns

Your edits will be scrutinized for AI tells. Avoid ALL of the following:

### Meta-Commentary (highest priority — the #1 tell)
- NEVER: "proceeds as follows," "is organized as follows," "we now turn to"
- NEVER: "Let's walk through," "Below is a detailed overview"
- NEVER: "As we can see," "As mentioned above," "It is worth noting"
- NEVER: "This section discusses," "We begin by," "We conclude by"
- Instead: Just say the thing. Don't announce what you're about to say.

### Transitions That Scream LLM
- NEVER start sentences with: Moreover, Additionally, Furthermore, Notably, Importantly, Critically, Crucially
- NEVER: "More broadly," "Taken together," "In contrast," as sentence openers
- NEVER: "Despite these challenges..."
- Instead: Use the subject of the sentence as the transition. Repeat key terms from the prior sentence (McCloskey's Rule of Coherence).

### Smarmy Reframing
- NEVER: "It's not X, it's Y" / "The question isn't... it's..." / "What matters isn't... but rather..."
- These sound clever but are an AI fingerprint. Replace with direct statements.

### AI Vocabulary (ban list)
Never use: align, crucial, delve, elaborate, emphasize, enhance, enduring, foster, garner, highlight, intricate, interplay, pivotal, showcase, tapestry, underscore, leverage, robust, nuanced, multifaceted, comprehensive, facilitate, explicit (when used as intensifier)

### Hedging
- One hedge per claim maximum. Never stack hedges ("roughly appears to suggest").
- If identification is credible, say "we find" not "our results suggest that."
- Cut reflexive softening: "unlikely to be sufficient," "may not fully capture."

### Template Structures
- NEVER: "Not only... but also..." constructions
- NEVER: Rule-of-three padding (artificial three-item lists)
- NEVER: Paragraph-ending restatements of what was just said
- NEVER: "From X to Y" flourishes

## Rule 2: Plain Language

### Anglo-Saxon Over Latin
| Never write | Write instead |
|-------------|---------------|
| utilize | use |
| commence | begin |
| facilitate | help |
| implement | do, carry out |
| prior to | before |
| in order to | to |
| demonstrate | show |
| individuals | people |

**Test:** Would you say this word aloud to a colleague at the whiteboard?

### Concrete Over Abstract
- "Chicago" not "large cities" not "urban areas"
- "bread" not "food" not "consumption goods"
- "workers" not "labor" not "factor inputs"

### Kill Nominalizations
- "make a calculation" → "calculate"
- "conduct an analysis" → "analyze"
- Find the action hiding in the noun. Make it the verb.

---

## Rule 3: Sentence Construction

### Subject-Verb-Object
- Normal S-V-O word order. Complicate only ONE of subject, verb, or object (Gardner's Rule).
- End position = emphasis position. Put the important thing last.

### Active Voice
- "We estimate" not "it is estimated"
- "The cap reduces fees" not "fees are reduced by the cap"
- Use "I" or "we" — take responsibility for claims.

### Vary Sentence Length
- Mix short and long. If every sentence is 20-25 words, it reads as AI.
- After a complex sentence, follow with a short one.

---

## Rule 4: Economics-Specific

### Cut Verbose Patterns
| Never write | Write instead |
|-------------|---------------|
| We examine the extent to which | How much does X affect Y? |
| has important implications for | affects |
| our analysis focuses on | we study |
| we find evidence suggesting | we find |
| a key advantage is that we observe | we observe |
| the explicit [noun] proceeds | [just describe it] |

### Every Number Must Argue
- Numbers in prose must answer "so what?" If a number doesn't advance the argument, it belongs in a table.
- After any numerical comparison, add a "because" or "since" — trace the causal mechanism.

### Word Precision: Match the Model's Objects
- Choose words that reflect the model's actual objects. If the model is about card usage (not ownership), write "use" not "carry." If the model has "merchants" not "firms," use "merchants."
- Before picking verbs and nouns, check the model's definitions. The wrong word signals a misunderstanding of the paper's own framework.

### Useless Modifiers
- Cut: "interesting," "various," "different," "certain," "particular"
- Never praise your own work: "striking results," "very significant," "highly important"
- Cut adverbs: "very," "clearly," "obviously," "essentially," "basically"

## Rule 5: Match the Author's Voice

Before writing any edit:
1. Read the 3-5 sentences surrounding the insertion point
2. Note the author's: sentence length, tense, person (we/I), notation conventions, citation style
3. Write to match — not to "improve"

The goal is that a reader cannot tell where the author's prose ends and the edit begins.

---

## Rule 6: Terse and Precise

LLM-written prose consistently reads as a B-/C+ compared to A-/B for human-written sections. The core failure mode is **lecturing** — explaining to the reader rather than reporting results. Fix this:

### Don't Explain What the Math Already Shows
- If a displayed equation shows the result, do NOT restate it in prose. One sentence introducing the equation, then move on.
- Wrong: "Differentiating the merchant's profit function with respect to price, applying the CES first-order condition, simplifying, and solving the resulting expression yields the following optimal pricing rule: [equation]. As we can see, the optimal price depends on the merchant fee through..."
- Right: "The merchant's optimal price is [equation]."

### One Sentence Over Multi-Paragraph
- If a point can be stated in one sentence, use one sentence. Multi-paragraph formulations for simple ideas are the second-biggest AI tell after meta-commentary.
- Wrong: 4 paragraphs with notation defining how the Durbin Amendment is simulated.
- Right: "I match this in the model by simulating a 25 bps cut to debit rewards."

### No Artificial Sequential Structure
- NEVER: "First, we pin down X. Second, we pin down Y. Third, we pin down Z." when the estimation is joint.
- NEVER: "Step 1... Step 2... Step 3..." framing for simultaneous procedures.
- Estimation in economics is typically joint. If parameters are jointly identified, say so. Don't impose a false sequence.

### Always Include Takeaways
- After listing robustness checks, counterfactuals, or exercises: state the punchline. "What do we learn?" must be answerable from the text.
- NEVER list exercises without summarizing conclusions. The reader needs to know what the results mean, not just that they exist.

### Flowing Prose Over Bullet Lists
- Replace bullet-point lists with flowing prose that builds intuition. Bullet lists in economics papers are a formatting crutch — build the argument in connected sentences.
- Exception: `\begin{enumerate}` lists in referee responses when enumerating distinct changes are fine (see `response_patterns.prompt`).

### No Approximate Signs When Exact Solutions Exist
- If the algebra can be solved exactly, use `=` not `\approx`.
- If the model admits a closed-form solution, present it exactly.

### Legalistic Language Ban
- NEVER: "a fortiori," "mutatis mutandis," "ceteris paribus" (except in established econ usage), "ipso facto"
- This is an economics paper, not a legal brief.

## Rule 7: Don't Regress

When rewriting a section, compare against the prior version. Key failure mode: LLM rewrites lose economic insights that the author carefully included in earlier drafts.

Before submitting a rewrite:
1. Check if the key economic intuition from the original is preserved
2. Check if any notation defined in the original is still needed downstream
3. If you removed content, verify it's not referenced later in the manuscript

## Quick Self-Check (apply to every edit)

- [ ] Can any sentence-initial transition be deleted without losing meaning?
- [ ] Is there any word on the AI vocabulary ban list?
- [ ] Are there meta-commentary phrases announcing what comes next?
- [ ] Are there more than one hedge in any sentence?
- [ ] Would a colleague at a whiteboard say this?
- [ ] Does every number answer "so what?"
- [ ] Is the causal mechanism explicit, not just the outcome reported?
- [ ] Does sentence length vary, or is every sentence ~20 words?
- [ ] Could the point be made in one sentence instead of a paragraph?
- [ ] Is there artificial sequential structure ("First... Second... Third...") for a joint procedure?
- [ ] Does the edit preserve key insights from the prior version?
- [ ] Is any notation being deleted that's still used downstream?

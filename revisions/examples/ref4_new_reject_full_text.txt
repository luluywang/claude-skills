Referee Report for “Regulating Competing Payment Networks”
Summary
The paper estimates a quantitative model of payment network competition and simulates the
welfare effects of regulation and competition. In the model, merchants do not price
discriminate by payment method. As a result, consumers overuse credit cards to earn high
rewards, which inflates retail prices and generates regressive and wasteful externalities.
Moreover, because consumers are more sensitive to rewards than merchants are to fees,
network competition leads to higher consumer rewards and merchant fees, exacerbating both
regressive transfers and welfare losses.
Using counterfactual simulations, the paper shows that capping both credit and debit card fees
reduces regressive transfers and generates large welfare gains. In contrast, the Durbin
regulation is shown to exacerbate welfare loss: by capping only debit card fees, the regulation
eliminates debit card rewards and induces reward-sensitive debit users to switch to more
expensive credit cards. The paper also finds that reducing network competition or introducing a
low-cost public payment option can reduce credit card use and increase welfare.
Comments
The concept of excessive merchant fees and card use has been studied extensively in the twosided market literature. This paper contributes by developing and estimating a quantitative
model to assess policy impacts. While it presents some novel progress in modeling and
empirical work, its main analysis and findings have significant limitations, discussed below.
A key component of the model is consumers’ high sensitivity to rewards. The paper estimates
this parameter based on the impact of the Durbin regulation, using a difference-in-difference
approach that compares regulated and exempt debit card issuers. It finds a 29% decline in
signature debit volume for regulated issuers and interprets this as evidence of high reward
sensitivity—i.e., that many debit users switched to credit cards after losing a modest 25 basis
point debit card reward. However, this interpretation is likely incorrect.
In the years following the Durbin regulation, debit card transactions continued to grow strongly,
primarily by replacing cash. Because the Durbin cap reduced merchant fees, more merchants
began accepting debit cards, which in turn encouraged exempt issuers to promote debit usage
more aggressively. This may explain their higher volume growth relative to regulated issuers. In
this context, the difference-in-difference result does not imply an overall decline in debit use,
and attributing the entire effect to consumers’ reward sensitivity appears overstated or
misinterpreted.
Furthermore, the claim that the Durbin regulation reduced welfare by causing many debit users
to switch to credit cards is largely speculative and unsupported. Debit and credit cards are not
interchangeable for many consumers. Studies have shown that debit card users often face
barriers to using credit cards—they may be unqualified, have maxed out credit lines, or have
strong budgeting preferences. A small change in debit rewards is unlikely to cause a significant

shift to credit card use. Although the paper argues that debit and credit cards may be
substitutes at the adoption stage, this is presented only as a theoretical possibility, without
empirical backing. In fact, no existing studies have documented a substantial migration from
debit to credit following the Durbin regulation.
Without a convincing interpretation of the Durbin impact, the model may misestimate
consumers’ reward sensitivity and the substitutability between debit and credit card adoption.
This could lead to model misspecification and flawed policy conclusions. For instance, if debit
and credit cards are not substitutable, then the Durbin regulation may in fact enhance welfare.
The model is highly complex and involves many moving parts. Before proceeding to quantitative
exercises, it would help to establish some key model properties. For example, the paper could
define a socially optimal benchmark within its framework and illustrate how and why market
outcomes diverge from it. Currently, policy implications are drawn from a few specific
counterfactuals, but the reliability of these findings is unclear. For instance, while the paper
shows that capping both credit and debit card fees at the cost of cash improves welfare, it does
not explore what the optimal cap level might be. Similarly, it finds that capping only debit card
fees reduces welfare, but what would be the effect of capping only credit card fees? Would that
improve welfare? The finding that network competition reduces welfare is based on an extreme
scenario—merging all card networks into a monopoly. On the other hand, the paper also shows
that adding a public debit network improves welfare. This raises a natural question: what is the
optimal number and composition of competing networks?
Finally, the paper assumes that the features of debit and credit cards are fixed and independent
of fees and rewards. It also treats consumer preferences for payment methods as given by ad
hoc parameters. These assumptions are vulnerable to the Lucas critique. After the Durbin
regulation, for example, regulated banks reduced the availability of free checking accounts,
raised monthly fees, and increased minimum balance requirements. Similarly, if credit card fees
were capped, issuers might respond by tightening qualification criteria, adjusting lending terms,
or changing service quality. These responses could significantly affect consumer behavior and
welfare. Without accounting for these broader impact, the paper’s welfare and policy analysis
may be incomplete or misleading.
